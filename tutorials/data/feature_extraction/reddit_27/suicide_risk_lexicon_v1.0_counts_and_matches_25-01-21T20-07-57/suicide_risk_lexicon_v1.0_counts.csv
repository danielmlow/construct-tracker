I deleted that post so I will try here. I figured this is more of a BPD issue than anything else because it directly involves my FP. I'm curious if other people with BPD can relate or can give me some insight. Here goes &amp;#x200B; I've been friends with this girl since January. Through all the failed friendships and hard times, she's been the only person to stick around. This is a big deal for me. She's been my FP for a very long time. I've lost all my other friends and now I might lose her too and I'm terrified &amp;#x200B; She's from a foreign culture. Relationships work a little different for her sometimes. In January she says she might have a relative come to visit, and if that's the case she said she'll have to delete all her apps (which means we won't be able to talk) she's mentioned the relative before but hasn't gone into detail about who they are. She said she has to delete all her apps and photos off her phone because this relative doesn't give her privacy. She won't talk to them about it or have her parents speak to them. I find it a little off. She said she can't because it's ""complicated"" &amp;#x200B; She started getting a little distant in September where she would go days without talking to me. I thought it was odd since we talk every day. Around that time she said her relative might be visiting, but they ended up not coming. I don't know if she is telling the truth or not. I find it odd that she won't talk about this relative and who they are, and allegedly can't have her own social media or privacy even though she's an adult. It's not her parents, so I don't know who it is &amp;#x200B; I'm scared of losing her. She's the only person I talk to and the only friend I have. Without her I \*literally\* have no one. No friends. No one to talk to. Nothing. She's all I have left. I asked her outright if she doesn't want to talk anymore and she said she still does, but her reaction to this is odd. I vented about it a little and she just shrugged it off, which is not like her. I've had so many people walk out on me and I'm scared this is going to be it for her. I don't know what to do.

14,"frustrated, broken, giving up My failed suicide attempt was about 12 years ago. About two months ago, I made a new suicide plan, I wrote my note, got my affairs in order, and made a last-ditch attempt to get help. I told my husband I wanted to die and that I needed help. I have a really precarious medical situation, and live in a pretty rural area, and even with the help of our local mobile crisis unit, we were unable to find any inpatient facilities that were willing to take someone as medically fragile as I am. I'm too sick for the kind of help I need. Ironic. I started outpatient therapy. It's helping, but I'm just so tired. I'm tired of being in pain, I'm tired of taking all of these meds to stay alive, I'm tired of fighting so goddamn hard. I'm trying, but I don't want to try anymore. My whole life has been one bullshit spectacle after another.  There are good parts, but I still wish every day that I had succeeded 12 years ago. My husband makes comments about what we'll do when we retire, and I can't fathom how miserable it will be to survive that long. I can't imagine how much pain I'd have to go through to reach retirement age. We don't expect me to really last through the next decade or so anyway, but I don't wan't to keep suffering. I'm tired. I drive my would-be friends away; the ones that stick around are the ones who also have chronic or terminal illnesses. The people I love are either dead, dying, or leave. I'm a financial drain and an emotional burden to everyone around me; I can't work or drive anymore. My life is meaningless. I don't want to hurt my husband. I've told myself I have to keep going at least until I finish the blanket I'm crocheting for him. For some reason, the thought of leaving that project unfinished is terrible. I would hate for him to have to live with an unfinished gift. So I have some time. I'm not sure when it will be done, but probably in a few weeks. I've decided on my method, and I still have my notes. Maybe between now and then I'll change my mind. Maybe I'll decide to go through with it before I finish making the blanket.
