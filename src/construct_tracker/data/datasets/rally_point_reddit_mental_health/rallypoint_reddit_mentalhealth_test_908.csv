3761,"Anyone prescribed or offered Prazosin? What is your opinion on it? I was having bad nightmares for years. I didn't want to think I had PTSD back then. Eventually my psychiatrist told me I might have it and that it's so bad that they wanted to prescribe me this new experimental medication. She told me it was a blood-pressure medication with an unlabeled use for stopping dreaming. I politely told her no because the concept seemed too science fiction and disturbing to me. I guess I have the belief that human beings need to dream in order to sort of repair themselves emotionally or something. I just feel like dreams are an important thing for humans to have, otherwise they wouldn't exist.

I'm curious though. Has anyone here been prescribed or using Prazosin? What type of effects do you experience? Does it take away nightmares but leave normal dreams or does it end all dreams completely? Does it have any side effects? Does it help you?

1721," |body| How to Live 400 Years

I read an article in the AARP Bulletin, titled “50 Great Ways to Live Longer.” Right away I knew I had to change my unhealthy ways and calculate my new longevity. My father lived to be 80 years old, so I always figured I’d live that long at least. I did the math below:

If I cut back on my pain pills, I would decrease my chances of heart attack or stroke by 10%. That adds 8 years (don’t get caught up in the details) to my life. That brings my life expectancy to 88 years.

If I get less than six hours of sleep, my chances of dying increases by 12%. Therefore, if I can get in six hours of sleep, my life expectancy will increase to 98.5 years. Looking good so far.

If I can stay married, I have a 46% lower risk of death compared to never married men. My life expectancy increases to 143+ years (1.46* 98.5). This might be a tough one.

By drinking coffee, I add another 15% to my life, bring my life expectancy to 165 years (143*1.15). I already drink coffee, so no biggy.

Eating three or more servings of whole grains per day, reduces my death by 20%. Now my life expectancy is up to 198 (165*1.20). I may start to moo.

Eating hot peppers reduces the death rate by 13%, bringing my expectancy to 223+ years. I’m on a roll here.

Drinking whole milk can add eight to ten years to my life. My life expectancy now increases to 233 years (223 + 10).

Switching to a vegetarian diet can deduce my death rate by 12%. As much as I love meat, this switch would add 28 years to my life. Life expectancy is now 261 years (233 + 28).

Stopping smoking reduces mortality by 15% or more. Now I expect to live to 300 (261*1.15%).

Loneliness increases the risk of early death by 45%. Therefore, if I stay social, I can add 135 years (300*.45%) to my life. I may live for 435 years.

My new plan to live to be over 400 is simple -- cut back on pain pills, sleep six hours, stay married, drink coffee, eat three servings of whole grains per day, eat hot peppers, drink whole milk, switch to a vegetarian diet, stop smoking, stay social. You can’t argue with math. See you in 400 years.",0.0,rallypoint first500

6388," |body| REV. DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR READ/SHARE OF THE DAY

(PIC) 1964, PORTRAIT  OF MLK

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.

Martin Luther King Jr. (January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American Christian minister and activist who became the most visible spokesperson and leader in the Civil Rights Movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. Born in Atlanta, Georgia, King is best known for advancing civil rights through nonviolence and civil disobedience, inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi.

King led the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and in 1957 became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). With the SCLC, he led an unsuccessful 1962 struggle against segregation in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham, Alabama. He helped organize the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech.

On October 14, 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance. In 1965, he helped organize the Selma to Montgomery marches. The following year, he and the SCLC took the movement north to Chicago to work on segregated housing. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty and the Vietnam War. He alienated many of his liberal allies with a 1967 speech titled ""Beyond Vietnam"". J. Edgar Hoover considered him a radical and made him an object of the FBI's COINTELPRO from 1963 on. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, recorded his extramarital liaisons and reported on them to government officials, and on one occasion mailed King a threatening anonymous letter, which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.

In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor People's Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee. His death was followed by riots in many U.S. cities. Allegations that James Earl Ray, the man convicted of killing King, had been framed or acted in concert with government agents persisted for decades after the shooting. Sentenced to 99 years in prison for King's murder, effectively a life sentence as Ray was 41 at the time of conviction, Ray served 29 years of his sentence and died from hepatitis in 1998 while in prison.

King was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal. Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established as a holiday in numerous cities and states beginning in 1971; the holiday was enacted at the federal level by legislation signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and a county in Washington was rededicated for him. The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.

As a sidebar, the closest thing I can compare suicide to is wanting to lose your virginity (albeit on the complete other end of the emotional spectrum); you don't care how it happens, you just have this burning desire for it to happen now. HOWEVER, I implore suicidal individuals to join me on a thought experiment. Pretend like you pulled the trigger (or whatever), tomorrow doesn't matter, right? Well then don't pull the trigger.

6433," |body| Ten Additional Ways Drivers Can Lose Their Licenses.

I read with interest and article on my news feed titled “12 ways good drivers lose their licenses” from Insutrance.com written by Karen Aho. She listed things like unpaid parking tickets, driving without insurance, overdue student loans and failure to pay child support. Of course, she missed some of the obvious ones. As a public service, I list 10 more ways to lose your license. Drive safely.
1.	Shooting at the police. In spite of the Second Amendment, in most states, shooting at the police is grounds to lose your license.
2.	Stealing a police vehicle. While this may be humorous, it is frowned upon by law enforcement. Don’t do it.
3.	Running over people in a crosswalk. For us older folks who grew up with games like Frogger, the classic video arcade game, it’s hard to realize there are no points for running down a pedestrian in a crosswalk.
4.	Trying to jump the gap on a draw bridge. I know it’s a challenge and to succeed would be tremendous, but the authorities could take your license if you do. If you fail, no one cares.
5.	Stopping in the middle of the road to pick up road kill. It might be overlooked if you share.
6.	Trying to see how far you can drive before running off the road with your eyes closed. I know we have all tried this, but law enforcement takes a dim view of this game.
7.	Trimming your toe nails while driving. It’s best to have a passenger trim your nails while driving. Don’t attempt this by yourself.
8.	Pretending to be a cop and pulling people over. This goes hand-in-hand with number 2 above.
9.	Making breakfast while you drive. Better to just go to a burger joint.
10.	Shooting squirrels from your car. I know, you have a right to have a weapon, but using it may be illegal. This may vary by state.

I’m sure you can think of other ways to lose your driving license. Tell me about them.

7131,"Wow. The Nightmares. Oh. My. Gosh. Forgot all about the PTSD nightmares. I'd fought them for years, and hadn't had them nearly as often lately -- or when I did, I  wasn't remembering them anymore, thank goodness. I recently got a secondary PTSD diagnosis related to medical surgeries/bone setting, and it has really kicked up my PTSD symptoms. Flinching from loud noises, contact, nightmares, anxiety, constant fear.

With the new secondary  medical PTSD diagnosis -- the nightmares have come back, are violent, and are atrocious. Was up and down all night, and finally slept around 6AM.  And then I finally slept, and WOW. The nightmares.

Was with a group of really shady people, and we were on some kind of late night mission. It all felt natural though, because I used to socialize with  some pretty shady people... -sighs- Don't ask. Just trying to get this out of my head so that I can shake reliving them in my head. Basically trekked with them to this unknown house, late at night, and everything went super south, super fast.

The people I was with -- they murdered a woman that used to be my friend. I mean, I got held back, tied up, and told I needed to watch this. It was like being apart of the Manson/Tate murders, without being included. And I like... watched her, her husband, and her three children, get murdered by these shady people. I didn't... *do* anything. I *couldn't*... do anything. I felt the helplessness. The inability to do anything. I hate my brain.

I think it was guilt. We had a  falling out a few years back over drug use. She got sick, and needed a heart transplant, and died less than a year after the transplant. She passed away a couple years ago, after a heart transplant failed to take.  She only had two kids. It felt so real. Like I hadn't seen her in so long, and in that time, she'd had another kid...

Three kids. Her  and her husband. Still hearing the damned screams. I don't remember it all -- but I definitely remember the screams. The blood. Stabbing. I started to realize it was a dream, and I was screaming. ""WAKE UP! WAKE  UP, IT'S NOT REAL. SHE DIED. I KNOW SHE DIED, WAKE UP."" I swore I was screaming in my sleep like I used to. I woke up abruptly, rolled out of bed, and just stared at the wall, breathing hard. It was bad. I forgot all about just how bad the night terrors are. They've been bad the past few weeks -- but this one... just... I can't shake it, and I'm still tearing up. Brutal.",1.0,reddit ptsd
1608,"Why do I fantasize and dream of being abused Please hear me out this sounds crazy but this is my truth and if anyone could offer me an explanation it would help. I can never find anything online that matches how I feel.

Okay so for years now I have literally desired to be abused in romantic relationships. For some reason it’s like an adrenaline high for me.

I am not a weak person I am very passionate and assertive otherwise. But for some reason the idea is appealing to me.

I literally fantasize about it TO FALL ASLEEP.

Yes in my childhood I was molested for like 3 years between 10 and 13. But i was not a willing participant at all I fought back every time I was disgusted at the thought. I also don’t think it was my fault. And I really hate the man who did it. So I don’t have sympathy for that abuser.

I also don’t feel like I deserve to be abused. It’s really just a thing that brings me a certain type of pleasure. Like when u get butterflies in your stomach.

I seek men that I know are at high risk to be violent.

I don’t believe in male superiority or anything and I don’t feel like I can be easily manipulated or controlled.

Please help I know this is psychotic. Its not something I’m ashamed of or even desire to change. But I know that it’s crazy.

I have managed to pass exams before with way less effort but since my eyes got worse I struggle a lot with studying I have this constant pain in my head and eyes  and it is really hard for me to focus. At least that's what the doctor and internet, upon research, told me.

Also through I did not plan that in the back of my mind I feel like that was just an act an excuses to get out of my failure. I am writing this on a throw away account because I fear the judgement of other people on me, I also feel bad of messing up those exams and if i tell my friends I tend to lie or make excuses for my failure.

1695," |body| Thursday, November 1, 2018 — Former US Navy SEAL, Ephraim Mattos, has responded to comments made by Don Lemon on CNN’s Cuomo Prime Time.

“We have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right, and we have to start doing something about them.” — Don Lemon on CNN (October 29, 2018)

Here is Mattos’ response:

""After surviving three wars, a gunshot wound, a near fatal drowning, a failed parachute, Taliban ambushes, ISIS snipers, mortars, mine-fields, suicide bombers and laying down my life for the cause of freedom while fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with my brother Arabs, Asians, Blacks, Hispanics, Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Animists, and Atheists, I have now returned home to the USA where a CNN host has labeled me as a radicalized right wing terrorist simply because of my gender and the color of my skin.

I represent just one of the hundreds of thousands of conservative white men who have fought to preserve freedom in this great Nation and in other nations. My forefathers are the 3% who founded this Republic against the might of the British Army. It was white Conservative men who died by the tens of thousands after charging into our southern states to free our black brothers from the slavery imposed on them by the Liberal left. We were the ones who acknowledged that women have a right to vote. We held the line in WWI and charged the beaches of Normandy in WWII. We have fought for freedom and liberty for generations and we continue to do so today alongside all of our brothers and sisters regardless of their race or religion.

In the early 1930s, Hitler said the same thing about the Jews that Don Lemon of CNN just said about white men. This is the true face of the Democratic Party. First they enslaved and killed blacks, and now they use them to spew hatred and lies against the very people who have fought for generations to free them and uplift them.  Remember that when you vote!

One final thought: To make a point, I have referred to myself as a “white male” in the previous sentences multiple times, but I must make it clear that I identify as simply “American,” not as “white” or “male” or “Republican.”

Although blatantly racist and hateful, do not let Don Lemon’s ignorant words drive you into viewing yourself only by your race and religion. Identity politics does not lead to freedom. It only leads to hatred and division and an “us vs. them” mentality.

If CNN does not fire Don Lemon, it only goes to show that they are truly the “enemy of the people.”

6190,"Absolutely! I am unsure how everyone will take my opinion, but we as veterans need to change the current perception of a ""veteran"" first.  Many joke about being ""Dysfunctional Veterans"" and not playing nice with others.  Let's be honest, if that is what our civilian counterparts hear from us, plus all the media attention on PTS, TBI, instability, suicides, etc, they will not trust us to do our part to help rebuild the economy.  We are ticking time bombs to many.  Veterans need to step up and be leaders in their community, be humble in the workplace/work their way up the chain if need be, and share their knowledge/intangible skills with their civilian counterparts.  Many civilian employers do not provide leadership training on par with what we have been through.  Find a mentor, become a mentor.

It's been brought to my attention that I may think I am more elite than civilians.  My best friend called me on it.  Now it is ok to think that (we are the 1%), but we have to show it tactfully and humbly.  We are joining their world and it's different than what we left when we joined X years ago.  Currently, I am transitioning from active duty to head to nursing school so I can do my part and live MY American Dream that will allow me to help people in my community and outside my community when I volunteer to be a traveling nurse.

3387,"Academic Pressure I'm a high schooler in the Bay Area. My friends are always talking about how many APs they're doing, or if they got a internship at some tech company over the summer, or about the new Android app they're building.

I'm a freshman.

I feel like I'm drowning. My school is in a upper middle class suburb of Silicon Valley. It's majority Asian. All of my friend's parents work at some sort of tech company. One of my friend's parents work at Apple. Another at Microsoft. Another at Google. To say that the academic pressure is pretty damn intense would be an understatement. It's the type of school where kids sometimes flat out kill themselves due to the stress, the kind you hear about in the news. In my school there's this unspoken rule that you have to major in CompSci if you ""want to amount to anything""

The Asian parent stereotype is true. Every single part of it. I don't want to say anything more.

Im pulling a 4.0 right now but I literally cannot afford to get a single B. I would kill myself if that happened, and it probably will.

Sometimes I'm just sitting in Spanish class and I start to think about how much easier it would be just to hang myself instead of doing Algebra II homework. I just want the stress to end. I just want to not have to get up every morning at 5:30, and trudge through the California cold (it's legit cold in the morning, shut up) to go to school literally before the sun even rises. Slowly but surely my life is going out of control.

I haven't done SAT prep in a few months now, and I need to raise my sat by about a hundred points if I want any hope of getting into a decent UC, I have a science Olympiad meeting tomorrow morning for like 4 hours and it's 2:30 am so I guess I'm not getting any sleep. I have to register the club that I run at a fundraising event, and fill out the paperwork for that. My coding projects are all behind schedule, and I'm so fucking depressed that my most recent project was a Python script called ""areyoustillalive.py"".and still need to learn Java to try to prepare for AP CompSci next year.

4461,"Anybody else get anxiety attacks over fears of cold sores? (MIGHT CONTAIN TRIGGERS) This is my first post here so I hope it’s under the right flair.

Out of all the things that trigger my anxiety (most stuff that needs to be dealt with immediately i.e. blood clot, toxic shock syndrome, flesh eating disease, heart attack) I most frequently am triggered my a fear of getting a cold sore. I’m 23 and I don’t think I’ve ever had one but every time I notice a funny feeling by my lip, or a red spot on my lip line, I can’t stop my mind from racing.

I know cold sores are harmless and that they’re incredibly common, but they terrify me. I worry that I will touch it and it will infect my eye and cause me to go blind, or infect my genital area. I also worry I will pick at the scab because I have additional Body Focuses Repetitive Disorders and I have an incredibly hard time not picking things on my face. I also think I’m scared from everyone seeing it on my face.

Even though I’ve never had one I worried I will get one. I know that over half of adults carry the herpes simplex virus, and that 90% of adults will get a cold sore in their life, but I’m terrified of the stigma. I haven’t ever gotten one even when I was sick, and I know they tend to come out when your sick. And I’ve heard of people only getting them once in their lives, or maybe once every 10 years, so I can’t get it out of my head that I’ll get one.

Can anybody else relate? Or anybody who gets them maybe give me some peace of mind? The anxiety can be completely overwhelming. I would really like some support and advice. ",1.0,reddit healthanxiety

""Fire And Rain"" written by James V Taylor.
Lyrics
""Just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone.
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you.
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song,
I just can't remember who to send it to.
I've seen fire and I've seen rain. I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end.
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend, but I always thought that I'd see you again.

Won't you look down upon me, Jesus, You've got to help me make a stand.
You've just got to see me through another day.
My body's aching and my time is at hand and I won't make it any other way.
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain. I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end.
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend, but I always thought that I'd see you again.

Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun.
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around.
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come.
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground.

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain. I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end.
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend,
but I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now.

Thought I'd see you one more time again.
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now.
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain, now.""

I go in for my first appointment.  Sit down and talk with her for about 45 minutes.  I explained my struggles / etc and that I felt like I may have ADHD-inattentive or whichever was ADD without the hyperactivity.  She says there was a difference between ADD and ADHD and that's when I kind of started questioning things.  Everything I've read says ADD is an outdated term and its all ADHD but anyways..  She has me fill out a questionnaire type thing (google adhd self test and its literally one like that).  Filled it out, she asked if I had any questions. Glanced over the 'test' and said she believes medication would benefit me and gave me 2 rx.  1 for adderall tablets and 1 for adderall XR.  She never actually diagnosed me with anything.. just said meds will benefit me and that was that?

6410," |body| Today's Scripture is from John 8:24


“Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.”--John 8:24. In this verse, Jesus emphasized that the fatal, unforgivable and eternal sin is failure to believe in Him as Messiah and Son of God. In Truth, all other sins can be forgiven if this one is repented of. God says some terrible things about the sins of those who refuse to believe in Jesus. He says they shall die in their sins; that their sins will follow after them; that they have no cloak to cover up their sins; that their sins remain on them.



Much too often we fail to understand God’s standard for sin. We, as believers have a blessed hope whereas the unbeliever doesn’t have hope and his sins will follow him to judgment. For those who don’t follow Christ, heaven will be closed against them and only perdition can await them. Jesus further shows that sin is the alienation of the heart from God. In this passage Jesus voiced conviction that man’s basic trouble, in any age, is sin and that the basic sin is unbelief. These men were perplexed but their perplexity was not brought about by their stupidity or mental limitations. They were blind sinners because their hearts refused to believe.



Jesus forewarned his hearers that He was going away. He predicted that after His departure they would recognize their error and quest for Him, but that opportunity for their repentance would be gone. “Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your sin remains.”--John 9:41. If they knew their lostness and darkness and cried out for spiritual light, they would no longer be guilty of the sin of unbelief in Christ. But satisfied that their darkness was light, and continuing in rejection of Christ, their sin remained.



Today I encourage each of you to take this great work that Christ has empowered us to deliver to the world and deliver it. We cannot allow people that we know and love or those who we don’t know to die in their sins. We need to be bold in our approach but lovingly explaining the Gospel. We should be willing to have them dragged over our dead bodies before we give up on them. Christ didn’t give up on us and we are to imitate Him.





Defending the faith!!!!!!!

This Evening's Meditation

C. H. Spurgeon

""Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.""—Hebrews 9:20.
HERE is a strange power about the very name of blood, and the sight of it is always affecting. A kind heart cannot bear to see a sparrow bleed, and unless familiarized by use, turns away with horror at the slaughter of a beast. As to the blood of men, it is a consecrated thing: it is murder to shed it in wrath, it is a dreadful crime to squander it in war. Is this solemnity occasioned by the fact that the blood is the life, and the pouring of it forth the token of death? We think so.

When we rise to contemplate the blood of the Son of God, our awe is yet more increased, and we shudder as we think of the guilt of sin, and the terrible penalty which the Sin-bearer endured. Blood, always precious, is priceless when it streams from Immanuel's side. The blood of Jesus seals the covenant of grace, and makes it for ever sure. Covenants of old were made by sacrifice, and the everlasting covenant was ratified in the same manner.

Oh, the delight of being saved upon the sure foundation of divine engagements which cannot be dishonoured! Salvation by the works of the law is a frail and broken vessel whose shipwreck is sure; but the covenant vessel fears no storms, for the blood ensures the whole. The blood of Jesus made His testament valid. Wills are of no power unless the testators die. In this light the soldier's spear is a blessed aid to faith, since it proved our Lord to be really dead.

Doubts upon that matter there can be none, and we may boldly appropriate the legacies which He has left for His people. Happy they who see their title to heavenly blessings assured to them by a dying Saviour. But has this blood no voice to us?

I also know once you make a lot of money, you become an operational cost target when times get rough. So if my productivity is high and my op cost is low... Yahtzee! I keep my job.

 My boss explained it was going to happen anyway but he asked why I didn’t want a raise.

“This is unsustainable.”

7055," |body| Complete and Effective Decision About Sin

By Oswald Chambers

…our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. —Romans 6:6


Co-Crucifixion. Have you made the following decision about sin—that it must be completely killed in you? It takes a long time to come to the point of making this complete and effective decision about sin. It is, however, the greatest moment in your life once you decide that sin must die in you– not simply be restrained, suppressed, or counteracted, but crucified— just as Jesus Christ died for the sin of the world. No one can bring anyone else to this decision. We may be mentally and spiritually convinced, but what we need to do is actually make the decision that Paul urged us to do in this passage.

Pull yourself up, take some time alone with God, and make this important decision, saying, “Lord, identify me with Your death until I know that sin is dead in me.” Make the moral decision that sin in you must be put to death.

This was not some divine future expectation on the part of Paul, but was a very radical and definite experience in his life. Are you prepared to let the Spirit of God search you until you know what the level and nature of sin is in your life— to see the very things that struggle against God’s Spirit in you? If so, will you then agree with God’s verdict on the nature of sin— that it should be identified with the death of Jesus? You cannot “reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin” (Romans 6:11) unless you have radically dealt with the issue of your will before God.

Have you entered into the glorious privilege of being crucified with Christ, until all that remains in your flesh and blood is His life? “I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me…” (Galatians 2:20).

5440,"Do you ever get out of depression completely ? My main question is, do you really come out of depression? I've had a couple depressive episodes during my life, even though I've had a really big one (around 4 year long), some times I feel I'm going to fall down again into that hole.

Quick notes. This is going to be the WHOLE story of my life without details. Also it's my first post and I don't know the format. Also English is not my native language.

Some background, when I was 8 my dad got a promotion from the company he worked in, this promotion also involved in him moving our whole family to another country. This change of, well everything caused major problems in my family. My older sister was affected harshly as she was around 2 years into college when we moved, but I don't really know how much it affected her. My parent's relationship was not in the best it could be, but they managed to remain together, what I can say about that is that their constant fighting really did affect me as a child, before we moved out of the country we lived in a house and they would manage to isolate me of their fights, but once we moved to the new country we had to learn to live in an apartment, and apartments are horrible to isolate problems and shouting so I had to suck up their discussions and cry because they where fighting.

Now, being in a new country the culture difference was shocking for all of us, in all the time from arriving to this country to this moment right now I had to pass through 3 different schools, all this change was caused by bullying done not only by students at each school, but even staff, it is a story for another time, but this problem was inter-scholar, and it got some high ranking staff members fired and their licences to  work in a children field revoked.

All this caused me to start self-harming, and I had 3 suicide attempts in my adolescence. Mainly the self-harming was discovered by school administration and was reported, instantly sending me to having therapy. First therapy I had was with the school's psychologist, who she made me see that every problem that happened was my fault and I should change and stop whining (As said above school staff also bullied me and it backfired really bad), after my mom receiving this news, she was also told that I was to be put into therapy with an outside psychologist of her choosing, I was a really aggressive child and stubborn one. The first psychologist I went my mom did not like his methods and removed me from his therapy. Second therapist I went, mom approved her method, but I became overly aggressive (on a quick note, I broke her door and a couple of large pots, and chairs in her office building. Third psychologist, I'll be honest, I lied my way out of therapy, or so I think.

After all this, I think that it is enough background, other small depressive episodes are small crappy teenage things that made me feel bad and I think it would be too much stuff put up here.

Now in 2016 my father passed because cancer.  Too long of a story, but it really affected all of us. I do not rally know if it belongs to the main story but it's really hard to lose a parent to cancer.

Now to the main story.

I am currently 4 days away from my 21st birthday. Since my 19th birthday I have been having this nostalgic feeling that makes me cry, every time I think about becoming a year older I feel bad, I miss my childhood, I start to cry when I am alone. I like seeing the things from my childhood, like pictures or music. I miss being a child, no responsibilities, no nothing, just happiness. I miss everything about . my childhood in my other country, I would love to go back in time and remain there. I have gone back to my home country 3 times,  the times I went back I felt like a tourist. I miss being a kid, everything got fixed right away,  problems did not last long, for me it was pure happiness compared to adulthood. Some times I want to end my life, I do not want to grow up. Also a lot of problems I have right now I blame on growing up. I don't know how to explain it, but it just feels wrong to grow up, I miss being a child.

After getting out of therapy about 6 years ago I have had 3 depressive episodes, but I do not know if you really get out of it and move on. These 3 episodes have lasted more than 2 months and they have really affected me. I do not know if anyone needs any more information, if it is needed I do not mind typing more about these episodes.",1.0,reddit mentalhealth

I've busted my ass to get where I am like every other American has to, regardless of race. I've been homeless 3 times but never stood on a corner begging. I've worked it out every time. My DNA results say that I carry virtually every race within my bloodstream but I'm automatically labeled a racist because I appear to be predominantly Caucasian. For this same reason I've been denied jobs, promotions, and access to education programs throughout my adult life but this system is 'unfair' to football players with 7 and 8 figure bank accounts who hate their country, disrespect our flag, our anthem, our war dead, and all who serve while playing a game in front of millions of cheering fans. Sure, I know it's their Constitutional 'right,' but how many of them have ever even read the Constitution, much less defended it? How many of them know what their rights really are?

On the 5th of Jan 2010 the neurosurgeon performed a discectomy, laminectomy, and an Open Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) fusing my L4-L5 vertebrae. This next part is a little hazy but when I awoke in the recovery room it felt like my right leg was going to explode. I was in the 7th level of Hell and screaming did no good. The nursing staff responded by giving me massive doses of morphine. I would drift in and out of consciousness waking only to scream while writhing in indescribable pain. I eventually went into acute respiratory failure and aspirated my own stomach fluids. I awoke to a crash team working to revive me. I had checked out of the net and only the quick thinking of a young 2LT nurse saved my life. He shot me up with Narcan which cancelled all the opiates out of my body. I remember this part very clearly. Two doctors were trying to determine if I'd had a heart attack, I was screaming and choking on my own puke, and an older woman nurse was whispering in my ear that everything would be alright. I asked for my wife and they said they'd sent her back to the hotel. I figured they didn't want her to see me die.

I have very unpleasant flashbacks of the physical and mental abuse I've experienced in childhood, but most of the time they extend towards vivid scenarios that haven't even happened.


One trigger sets off a cascade of reactions where I start from a flashback of a painful memory to a vivid and hypothetical mental simulation dealing with a similar premise as the memory.

Section 6 - CONCERNING DELIVERANCE FROM SINNING

Dear friend, salvation would be a sadly incomplete affair if it did not deal with this part of our ruined estate. We want to be purified as well as pardoned. Justification without sanctification would not be salvation at all. It would call the leper clean, and leave him to die of his disease; it would forgive the rebellion and allow the rebel to remain an enemy to his king. It would remove the consequences but overlook the cause, and this would leave an endless and hopeless task before us.

It would stop the stream for a time, but leave an open fountain of defilement, which would sooner or later break forth with increased power. Remember that the Lord Jesus came to take away sin in three ways; He came to remove the penalty of sin, the power of sin, and, at last, the presence of sin. At once you may reach to the second part—the power of sin may immediately be broken; and so you will be on the road to the third, namely, the removal of the presence of sin. ""We know that he was manifested to take away our sins.""

The angel said of our Lord, ""Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins."" Our Lord Jesus came to destroy in us the works of the devil. That which was said at our Lord's birth was also declared in His death; for when the soldier pierced His side forthwith came there out blood and water, to set forth the double cure by which we are delivered from the guilt and the defilement of sin.

Officially, I can see they would not be condoned or endorsed, but the impossible task of being the man against several others who would tacitly deny such an act taking place proved frustrating. kind of like the mysterious way that my civilian clothes suddenly appeared in my dirty clothes bag during Basic, which led to me being summarily dropped from bypass training because of my Civil Air Patrol background. All our civilian clothes were LOCKED in a storage area adjacent to the day room for our flight, so I would like to know how that came about. Did my TI conspire to do this, or was there a key that other airman recruits had access to, which they brazenly took and then searched for my baggage to find my stuff, and then put it in my dirty clothes bag, which was subsequently ""found"" by my TI who inspected my gear and living space while I was returning from drill with the assistant TI, and I was singled out, and taken up inside our dorm and confronted by all this alone, while everyone else was outside. And this same TI also decided to violently rip a handful of chest hair that was above the neckline of my T-shirt under my fatigue shirt, and insisted that I had not properly ""shaved"" that morning. It had been there before, but why was that done then? I did exactly what I was asked to do, and never was one to cause trouble, and because of my CAP background, I demonstrated solid military bearing and compliance with what I was asked to do.

Lately her husband has been extremely moody towards her, me, and his own family and friends. Potentially ruining their friendships. He's supposed to be on medication for depression but he went off it saying ""it just hides the fact that she's (my sister) cheating on me.""

He's obsessed over thinking my sister cheats on him. Constantly accusing her of talking to men on her phone or even at work. She knows it's a form of mental abuse. She talks about leaving him but she thinks he has a mental illness that causes him to think this way. She does still love him, even after all this. This happens every 2 months.

He also talks about wanting to die a lot during these episodes.

What can I say to him that will maybe think about getting therapy or going to his PCP for a prescription change?

What can I say to him to help bring him out of this current episode and back to reality?


I'm posting this for advice. I care about my family. He is my family and I want to help anyway I can. He's a really nice guy when he's not in these episodes. She's hurt and depressed. She wants to help him, not just give up and leave him. That's last resort.",1.0,reddit mentalhealth

Navy recruit dies at boot camp
By:  Geoff Ziezulewicz   

(PIC) A Navy recruit died Tuesday at the Navy's boot camp at Great Lakes, Ill. Recruits are shown there earlier this month. (Navy)


A recruit died Tuesday at the Navy’s boot camp in Great Lakes, Illinois, officials confirmed Thursday.


Seaman Recruit Kelsey Nobles, 18, collapsed following her final physical fitness assessment, according to Recruit Training Command spokesman Lt. Joseph Pfaff.


The Alabama native went into cardiac arrest and was taken to a nearby civilian hospital, where she was pronounced dead, according to the Naval Safety Center.


“The Navy, and Recruit Training Command, take the welfare of our recruits and Sailors very seriously and are investigating the cause of this tragic loss,” Pfaff said in an email. “Our thoughts are with Seaman Recruit Nobles’ family and friends during this tragic time.”


Nobles is at least the second Navy recruit to die under such circumstances at Great Lakes in recent months.


Seaman Recruit Kierra Evans, 20, collapsed and died Feb. 22 while undertaking her own physical fitness assessment a week before she was scheduled to graduate.

The investigation into the cause of Evans’ death remains ongoing, according to Lake County, Illinois, coroner Howard Cooper.


Pfaff said that after Evans’ death, the command reviewed “the training, safety, medical processes, and overall procedures regarding the implementation of the (physical fitness assessment) and found no discrepancies in its execution.”


“If information is discovered during the course of the investigation revealing deficiencies in our processes or procedures, that could improve safety in training, it would be acted on,” Pfaff said.

Also, in regards to medication, should I mention anything? I don’t want them to think I’m only after the drugs.

4474,"Well for me it was very hard for me to ask for help. I retired in 1997 and when I came home everyone was just looking at me( to me that is) they were not but people hadn't seen me for over 21 years and I was a different person. Also most people I knew where prior service and you just didn't ask for help. So after DS and OIF the doctors and VA and other people started learning that we all had seen some very bad things. So in 2006 I finally went to the VA mental health cause I was at that point also. So in saying all of this a lot of us just don't want people feeling bad, or have pity on us. In saying all of this I have went through two divorces, tried doing bad things and when I got help cause a good friend also a combat veteran took me too the local VFW and found out that there were other's like me and I am now remarried and have been for over 6 years and with her family and my doctor from long beach I am doing so so so much better so if see someone or know someone with signs get them to the hospital, or VA anyway you can get them too understand that we all need help at sometime in our life.

3292,"My Intervention and Need for Insight **trigger warning for reference of rape**



Hi, so last night I was given an intervention by my new boyfriend, who believes that I have PTSD from a rape that happened several years ago.
 I have been medically diagnosed with severe depression and an anxiety attack disorder.
This diagnosis came two years after I had been raped at the age of 16 and a virgin too nonetheless.
At the time I felt as if I had no case so I didn’t report it to my family or the police. Since the attack I’ve struggled heavily with intimacy and trust in men.
Now I’m 20 years old, a full time university student and far away from my attack but recently I’ve started to deal with some symptoms that I wasn’t used to with my current disorders.
 I’ve started to have nightmares sometimes daily about my attack. It happened in a wooded area very similar to the woods I have to walk through to reach my bus stop for school and I cannot stop dreaming about the men in my life cornering me in those woods.
Combined with the nightmares I’ve had several episodes of a lover touching my back during sex and I think I had what’s considered a flashback although I’m not very sure. All I know is that it terrifies me.
My boyfriend believes that I’m struggling with PTSD symptoms due to my attack but I don’t understand why I would have them now 4 years later??
Is that even possible?
I would really appreciate some insight from those who have been diagnosed and wether or not you believe my symptoms hold cause for my to get tested.",1.0,reddit ptsd

2725,"Am I in hell or am I having delusions? Help I’ve posted this in two places because I’m not sure where it belongs

What I am about to type is so hard. So hard, hard to the point where I refuse to write about it in my personal journal and I’ve never told a soul. I’m scared to write it and scared what the consequences will be for me.

Two years ago I took mdma (one time of many) and smoked weed and had the worst trip you could imagine. It was like I’d opened the gates to hell and I spent the next however many hours, distressed and feeling like the devil was after me. Ever since then I’ve thought the devil is after me. Green lasers were coming out of my friends’ eyes and I think from the right hand corner of the ceiling too. I feel like my whole life had been gearing up to that moment and the evil people were waiting for it, to make me aware of what was going on. That I’m being punished, maybe for what I did in a past life. I know this sounds crazy.

Literally everyday I feel like this isn’t real, you’re all actors and everyone is in on this ploy. That I’m the centre of everything and everyone’s purpose is to punish me. I can’t describe what it felt like, I felt completely detached from reality, not normal, out of it, dissociated. Before this “trip” I suffered with dissociation but now it’s worse than ever, I feel like I’m not real, I can’t see properly, I never feel present. I’m still able to maintain relationships, by the way, and I have a boyfriend. I’m also a mother.

I’m scared of the colour green and sometimes things will be green out of the corner of my eye but when I look, they’re not actually green and I know that’s a sign to remind me of what is going on. I won’t kill myself, because I know what is next is worse. The second I die I’ll enter that horrible world that I got a glimpse of the night I did those drugs. I get panicked usually every few days because I’ll get a feeling like I’m entering back into that state/place and that it’s happening again.

I am still able to enjoy things in life, but I am very depressed. Not just because of this, but I’d imagine this is a big contributor. I feel like I’m trapped because I want to die, but I can’t die because if I do then it will just be even worse than this.

I know this sounds crazy. I know. I am still able to function highly Day to day, nobody in my life has the slightest clue this is happening.

I try to tell myself that this isn’t real, but deep down I think I know that it is. The only reason I’m reaching out is on the off chance this isn’t real and it’s all in my head, I know you’ll all tell me it’s not real but you’re all in on it so it makes no difference.

I don’t know what to do, I’m too embarrassed to go to the GP that I’ve seen since I was born. I’m under a mental health team for my depression and anxiety and I’ve lied to them the whole time, they don’t even know that I used to do drugs. Anti psychotics won’t help either will they, because it’s been so long?

384,"I bought my home in Colorado in 1990. The house was $117,000. It was a little bit of pain to go through the process but no more so than any other govt backed mortgage (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, USDA etc.) It took 2 to 3 months as best I can recall. Things like crap on your credit history like unpaid dentist or medical. And that's with ok credit. Not great. My score was in the low 600's.
Fast forward to today and I'm a real estate broker.  I'm a member of the Legion and VFW in my hometown of Saugerties NY. I've been doing this for 7 years.. There are people to watch out for. I don't trust any person or business that offers special treatment for Vets. But that's just me. Anyone is entitled to make a profit for a service. I've been truly blessed. I got out 9 FEB 1969.

And for whatever reason, when everyone was sent to Nam, my entire company was assigned everywhere but Nam. Most went to Germany and Okinawa and all over the world. Me and a couple other guys went Korea. Joint Security Area Panmunjom. In April of 1968 my best friend Sgt James Anderson (Andy to us) was killed in an ambush in a routine shift change. I made that same ride thru the zone countless times. I made it back. Andy and 3 others didn't
I only tell you all this because of my gratitude to those who gave all I've been trying to help any vet buy a house. I will not accept any commission or payment of any kind to do what I normally get paid very well for.  In 6 years I can't find any vet who could use my help and expertise. I'm licensed in the state of New York and I'm told that what I'm trying to do might violate some rule or law. Probably to to protect against a predator.

Army combat veteran gets 55-year sentence for killing, burying his wife behind his parents’ home

SKOWHEGAN, Maine — A judge on Friday declared a defendant’s trial testimony “poppycock” before sentencing him to 55 years in prison for killing his wife and burying her body with a wedding band, flowers, potato chip bag, and a bottle of Gucci cologne called “Guilty.”

The judge said he was “disgusted” by the conduct of Army combat veteran Luc Tieman, who was convicted last month of murder.
Tieman, of Fairfield, Maine, didn’t speak during the sentencing in Superior Court. But he has contended he didn’t kill his wife, whom he admitted burying behind his parents’ home.
Tieman originally told investigators 34-year-old Valerie Tieman disappeared at a Walmart, but he later changed his story to say she died from a heroin overdose. An autopsy showed she had ingested painkillers but died from two gunshots.


A prosecutor told the judge that Valerie Tieman was “gunned down” in August 2016 by the man who vowed to love and protect her.



The victim’s family, from South Carolina, urged the judge to impose a life sentence instead of the 55-year sentence sought by prosecutors. The defense sought a 35-year sentence.



“A big part of me is gone,” the victim’s mother, Sarajean Harmon of Taylors, South Carolina, said in a statement read aloud at the hearing. She wrote that she was “overwhelmed by what an evil-hearted man Luc is.”

Tieman wept as his mother and father asked the judge for mercy.



His mother, Laurelle Tieman, said her son was changed when he returned from three combat tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. She said she wasn’t looking to use his post-traumatic stress disorder as an excuse but added, “I am asking for understanding.”

The prosecutor contended Tieman killed his wife to be with another woman he’d met on Facebook. Luc Tieman moved in with that woman and never reported his wife missing, prosecutors said.

Valerie Tieman’s parents, both of whom were in court Friday along with her brother, eventually contacted police on Sept. 9, 2016.



Luc Tieman offered no explanation why the grave contained the unusual items, some of which had been on his bedside table in his parents’ home.



Valerie Tieman was wrapped in a blanket and buried in a shallow grave along with flowers, a wedding band, a bag of potato chips, cologne and a note.

4919," |body| ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY....3 June 1969 at about 0300-0400, 74 Sailors from USS Frank E. Evans DD-754 died in about 2 minutes in the South China Sea, Southeast of Saigon, South Vietnam due to a collision at sea with HMAS Melbourne, an Australian Aircraft Carrier.  I was stationed on my first ship, USS Kearsarge CVS-33 which was the centerpiece of our Battle group of ships that included USS Frank E. Evans DD-754 as well as several other Destroyers, cruisers, Frigates and various support ships. Just hours before, USS Frank E. Evans was providing shore bombardment in support of a Marine engagement on Yankee Station, North Vietnam. The result of the collision with Melbourne, the Evans was cut in half, with the Bow half sinking in about 2 minutes taking 74 men to a watery grave. There were probably close to 200 survivors either in the water or on the aft section of the ship which stayed afloat. There were no Casualties on Melbourne. Among the crew that did not survive were three brothers all serving serving together on USS Evans which was something the Navy had not allowed since all the Sullivan Brothers were killed on their ship in WWII. In addition to that, the Navy granted a request of a Chief Petty Officer's request his young (just out of Boot camp) be assigned with him on the Evans. The Chief Survived, his son did not! My ship, USS Kearsarge was on scene approx 15 minutes after the collision and launched Helo's and small boats. There were many injured survivors brought to Kearsarge as we had a large medical crew and facilities on board. Of the 74 dead, only one body was recovered. The critically injured were flown to Saigon in South Vietnam by our aircraft. This event occurred 49 years ago today and even though that was a long time ago, I remember it like it was yesterday, and I always take the time to remember the lost 74 sailors of the Evans may they rest in peace. The second to last photo below shows the bow of Melbourne with Kearsarge in the background.The last picture below shows USS Kearsarge CVS-33 with USS Frank E. Evans along side.

Their hypocrisy on gun control sickens me.  Truth is, if they really cared, they would start with a couple of privileges before treading on ones right.

1.The privilege to operate a motor vehicle gives us the privilege to kill and wound at astounding numbers.

In 2015, 2,333 teens in the United States ages 16–19 were killed and 235,845 were treated in emergency departments for injuries suffered in motor vehicle crashes.1 That means that six teens ages 16–19 died every day from motor vehicle injuries.

In 2013, young people ages 15-19 represented only 7% of the U.S. population. However, they accounted for 11% ($10 billion) of the total costs of motor vehicle injuries.

Nearly 1.3 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day. An additional 20-50 million are injured or disabled. More than half of all road traffic deaths occur among young adults ages 15-44.

2. Cellular phone use and distracted driving.

3. Alcohol consuming teens driving.

For a while I was taking weekend breaks to avoid tolerance build but I found myself cruddy and unable to get anything done so now I’m going to try everyday with the new dose.

The problem for me is how sensitive I am to stimulants. They don’t affect my appetite but I can’t sleep on them so I take a medication for that. Then I started getting fluttery heart so now I take a beta blocker for that as needed. But at first they were great and now it’s like when I come down at night I get irritable, start picking at my hair and scalp, and go into an agitated depression and feel like the medication is changing me (this is only late in the evening when medication is gone not when medication is in effect).

The thing is that I have adhd friends who don’t get this at all. They don’t get racing heart, they can go right to sleep, they don’t get revved up or agitated at night, etc. But I do and it makes me doubt that I have ADHD regardless of any benefit that the medication brings me.

My doctor is trying to work through this with me and has said I may just be sensitive to the adrenaline effects that the medication is causing or I may have comorbid bipolar II or mixed depression. He’s telling me that we will keep trying different doses and medications (maybe switching to Dexedrine, back to Ritalin, or trying non-stimulants).

I have had a really hard time managing it on my own, especially alongside my other mental health struggles like bipolar and an eating disorder.  I was on the waitlist for counseling at the overcrowded local community health center for close to a year and I finally had my intake appointment last week.  I disclosed what happened to me to a professional for the first time ever, and he was also only the third person I ever told.  I had to answer a lot of questions about it for the first time.  The experience of answering specific questions about it without giving me any way to cope with it has thrown me into a horrible week-long spiral.  Finals are next week and I have no space in my brain to think about anything other than my trauma or the feelings that come with it.  Last night I had one of the worst flashbacks I’ve ever experienced and I shook and cried in my boyfriend’s arms until I passed out.  I feel like such a burden on him.  I don’t even have the energy or motivation to walk into class.  I’ve been sitting in my car in the parking lot at school for 2 and a half hours because I can’t collect myself enough to go inside.  That feeling that something horrible is about to happen has consumed me and filled me with dread for a whole week and it won’t let go.

I was diagnosed with Aspergers’ Syndrome when I was around 13-14, my mum wanted me tested because I had heavy anger issues and she knew that something wasn’t quite right, and then “bam, Aspergers’ Syndrome”

Recently for the past 2-3 years, I’ve been in constant routine and I do not like change one bit unless I can adjust to it. But recently in the past months I cannot leave without making sure that my switches are off, the windows are shut, my iPad is in a safe place, and that make sure the back door is locked and then when I leave, making sure the gate is locked repeatedly and that the side door is locked repeatedly. I do this even if I go to the shop which is a 2 min walk and back, it’s getting unbearable and I cannot break it.

And with the main issue, I cannot stop making sure the gate is locked, I smoke frequently and have to go in the garden as my parents don’t smoke, but with making sure that the gate is locked when I come back in has broken and I still do it now, the time I go out for a cig is usually when I parents are either in the shower or bath and that they can me slamming the gate.

I will be ultra paranoid and will stress about it, thinking “oh god did I shut it” and “did I even lock it?!” I cannot break this routine, my mum has just yelled at me recently for lying as I said the gate just slammed but she heard me slamming the locked gate to make sure it’s locked. I cannot get myself for work or college, I am not independent, and I am paranoid if I break routine and that if I do break it, “the worst will happen”

Many parents who have children and give them away for adoption for reasons which they may face forget that the ones they are giving always for a better life soon will be adults with feelings and will attempt to fine closure. questions like where did I came from, why was I given away for adoption, whom am I what's my real race, Well that sort of thing. To clone a human for combat purposes is like to make babies whose purpose if to fight. When talking about stem cell, remember they are humans and may find some sort of resentment. One thing is they will have eyes, ears, they will breath the same air, eat the same food and learn the same way. So with this how would they feel to see us (the not clone), having children with a father, mother brothers and sisters celebrating all these holidays as a family while they remain isolated reserved for the purpose of combat only? Even if these clones were giving to real parents to raise for the Feds, it would be really hard to accept that idea by those parents, that someday they have to give back what is not there's to the Feds so they fight and get killed like as if nothing really mattered. On the other hand, if the USA can do it so can any other country, and if they clone as well, then we as humans had better get our ethics together because we will be way off track. Now if I ever find out that such a clone was made I'm going to steal it and raise it myself the normal way. To allow a human clone to fight for my freedom is not required, I can do that myself.

VIETNAM VETERAN SHARES:

 Billy Dutches, Hawthorne, NJ.. cya on the other side billy.

 I KNOW HE GOES TO WAR

 I can't tell you of ever finding God in church
 And I can't remember feeling He was near me when I was there.

 I do remember seeing a lot of friendly faces and people dressed in all their nice cloths.
 Somehow, I always felt uneasy - too many people, too close.

 No, I don't remember seeing God in church but I hear His name there constantly.
 Some ask ""Have you been born again"" If so, when? And I don't understand!

 I did feel God in Vietnam
 almost everyday.

 I felt Him when, after an all-night fire fight,
 He sent the sun to chase the rain away; and the rain would return with majesty the very next day.

 He was there when I collected Sgt. Moore's body parts to put in a body bag.
 He was there when I wrote a letter to his widow explaining how he died.

 He was behind me when I heard Sgt. Sink's last dying gasp.
 He helped me carry Sgt. Swanson down a hill in the An Loe Valley.

 I caught a glimps of God when I felt the heat of Napalm
 called on our own position, May 27, 1967.

 I felt Him around me when
 the Chaplain would hold field services for our dead.

 I saw His reflection in the faces of my men when I told them to save one bullet for themselves
 as we were about to be overrun one hot steamy day in a Nam far away.

 He led me in the ""Lords Prayer"" on every air assault
 as we stood on the skids coming in at treetop level.

 When we set up our night ambushes and I couldn't see my own hands because of the darkness,
 I would feel His hands.

 He sent lonelines to guarantee fond memories
 that always appear later in life.

 I'll always remember the strength God gave to the orphans - the children of war.
 He made them strong, but they didn't understand.
 I know after 25 years, we sleep under the same star.

 He sent boys to war. They returned young men;
 their lives forever changed, proud to protect the land of the free.

 I don't know if HE goes to church,
 but I know He goes to war.

I have come a long way than where I was two years ago. Two years ago I was binge drinking daily and it was terrible on my health, as you can imagine. I have slowly been able to wean myself down. Now I drink about once a week, on weekends only. I stop before it becomes excessive and before I make terrible decisions, which is fantastic. I want to get it down to once a month and then eventually to every once in a while. Psychologically speaking it is not entirely too difficult. I would often smoke weed instead, but even now I can have multiple nights in the row of complete sobriety (yay!). However one thing has been holding me back tremendously and it is literal torture. The night after drinking I will be okay, as long as I remain hydrated and prevent a hangover. By the second night I start getting really bad restless leg syndrome. I figured if I go long enough that it goes away, but I am finding that it gets progressively worse as the week goes on. I didn't want to drink last night but the physical itch in my body was just too much when all I wanted to do was relax before my weekend.


I have taken some actions like cutting back on caffeine and other solutions provided by the internet. However I wanted to see if anyone here has any advice that can help me manage my sobriety so that I can do things like get a full night's sleep. I am not on any medications that would affect dopamine levels. By the way, I am going to bring it up with my doctor next month because I have a physical. So I am not looking for medical advice as much as remedies that have helped you.

3112," |body| Now I do not think that Satan much cares to destroy us Christians physically. The soldier dead in battle who died performing some deed of heroism is not a great loss to the army but may rather be an object of pride to his country. On the other hand the soldier who cannot or will not fight but runs away at the sound of the first enemy gun is a shame to his family and a disgrace to his nation. So a Christian who dies in the faith represents no irreparable loss to the forces of righteousness on earth and certainly no victory for the devil. But when whole regiments of professed believers are too timid to fight and too smug to be ashamed, surely it must bring an astringent smile to the face of the enemy; and it should bring a blush to the cheeks of the whole Church of Christ. The devil's master strategy for us Christians then is not to kill us physically (though there may be some special situations where physical death fits into his plan better), but to destroy our power to wage spiritual warfare. And how well he has succeeded. The average Christian these days is a harmless enough thing. God knows. He is a child wearing with considerable self-consciousness the harness of the warrior; he is a sick eaglet that can never mount up with wings; he is a spent pilgrim who has given up the journey and sits with a waxy smile trying to get what pleasure he can from sniffing the wilted flowers he has plucked by the way. Such as these have been reached. Satan has gotten to them early. By means of false teaching or inadequate teaching, or the huge discouragement that comes from the example of a decadent church, he has succeeded in weakening their resolution, neutralizing their convictions and taming their original urge to do exploits; now they are little more than statistics that contribute financially to the upkeep of the religious institution. And how many a pastor is content to act as a patient, smiling curator of a church full (or a quarter full) of such blessed spiritual museum pieces.

The incident below, related by a Union army veteran in A. L. Long’s Memoirs of Robert E. Lee, is said to have taken place on July 3, 1863, the last day of the Battle of Gettysburg. It speaks of an American brotherhood that, in the end, transcended that terrible war.

	I was at the battle of Gettysburg myself. . . . I had been a most bitter anti-South man, and fought and cursed the Confederates desperately. I could see nothing good in any of them. The last day of the
fight I was badly wounded. A ball shattered my left leg. I lay on the ground not far from Cemetery Ridge, and as General Lee ordered his retreat he and his officers rode near me.

As they came along I recognized him, and, though faint from exposure and loss of blood, I raised up my hands, looked Lee in the face, and shouted as loud as I could, “Hurrah for the Union!”

The general heard me, looked, stopped his horse, dismounted, and came toward me. I confess that I at first thought he meant to kill me. But as he came up he looked down at me with such a sad expression upon his face that all fear left me, and I wondered what he was about. He extended his hand to me, and grasping mine firmly and looking right into my eyes, said, “My son, I hope you will soon be well.”

If I live to be a thousand years I shall never forget the expression on General Lee’s face. There he was, defeated, retiring from a field that had cost him and his cause almost their last hope, yet he stopped to say words like those to a wounded soldier of the opposition who had taunted him as he passed by. As soon as the general had left me I cried myself to sleep there upon the bloody ground.

He went to rehab to respect our wishes and see if the possibility of sobriety was even an option and even though he hated every second of being there, he has not touched a drug since.

Read:
Luke 2:15-20

They will call him Immanuel, which means “God is with us.” -Matthew 1:23

A stable? What a place to give birth to the Messiah! The smells and sounds of a barnyard were our Savior’s first human experience. Like other babies, He may even have cried at the sounds of the animals and the strangers parading around His temporary crib.

If so, they would have been the first of many tears. Jesus would come to know human loss and sorrow, the doubts His brothers and family had about Him, and the pain His mother experienced as she saw Him tortured and killed.

All these hardships—and so much more—awaited the baby trying to sleep that first night. Yet from His very first moments, Jesus was “God is with us” (matthew 1:23), and He knew what it meant to be human. This would continue for over three decades, ending at His death on the cross.

Because of His love for you and me, Jesus became fully human. And being human allows Him to identify with us. Because of Him, we can no longer say that no one understands us. Jesus does.

May the Light that entered the world that night cast its brilliance into the deepest corners of our souls this Christmas, giving us the peace on Earth of which the angels spoke so long ago.

7719,"- I was active duty when I had my first child. He was delivered by c-section, which messed up my stomach muscles something terrible. When I came back from maternity leave, I did everything I could plus extra to lose weight and to get back into shape. However, my leadership from squad leader on up to the Captain of our company could care less about me and whether or not I passed the PT test or even if I made tape.

So trust me, SGM Marquez, I am not missing anything. My Company Commander was a complete jackasss. He brought myself and two other females that were pregnant into his office and point blank asked each one of us if we knew who the fathers were. 2 of us were married, the other girl came to our unit already pregnant. Yes we did report him to the EO NCO and nothing was done. Since that had happened, he had it out for me, gave me my ETS paperwork a week before my ETS date. He was overheard saying it got lost in a shuffle since I requested time off as well.  So there was a lot of things I had to pass over in order to ETS on time.

The only ones that have encouraged me and have had my back was when I was a Corrections Officer. At least they were more loyal to me as a newbie than my own military unit in the Army.

Don't get me wrong, I am grateful for the structure and changes it brought about in me, but it also made me wonder how much more women or even men have to become shamed for their looks. Not everyone can be super skinny or muscular, you work with what you have and go on. I was that skinny person when I went to basic but I was also athletic so it put me over my weight so had to be taped. I could kill it on push up and sit ups, running was my down fall, basic training about killed me, I would later find out. I am highly allergic to wool and to grass. But I pressed on. I was up every night coughing my lungs up and keeping some of the others up at night too. I didn't want to give in.

No one is perfect. And if anyone claims to be, I will be the first one to call bull shit and laugh in their face. So for me to miss a point...nope, I right on point. People are even on medication that will keep them from losing weight.

1111,"Major Mike was laid to rest... a decorated veteran and dog |body| A highly unusual memorial and burial, in the small rural farming town of Powell, Wyoming, is being held today to celebrate and lay to rest a soldier.

This soldier loved chasing tennis balls and chewing on them, his reward for a job well done in the war zone. In fact, whenever he discovered anything round and relatively soft, he was giddy. He served two harrowing tours of duty in Iraq with distinction and was promoted to major when he retired from an Army special operations group.

The military had named him K-9 Mike 5 #07-257, but he came to be known as “Major Mike,” or Michael, as his war and peacetime partner, retired Army ranger Matthew Bessler, liked to call him.

After returning from Iraq with Mike in 2010, Bessler adopted the dog, a Belgian Malinois and had him trained for a new job: a service dog that, for the past several years, had instinctively detected and eased the anxiety and depression in his human counterpart.

That was until last month, when Mike was shot to death by a bicyclist who said the dog was attacking him. The bicyclist — who is a veteran himself, honorably discharged from the Army, authorities said —insisted he had no intention of killing Mike, only disabling him so he could ride away.

The dog’s death shattered Bessler’s delicate world, as he and the dog were both recovering from post-traumatic stress, and drew worldwide attention. Not long after Mike’s death, Bessler’s friends began organizing a fundraising campaign to cover the costs of the funeral. Meanwhile, Bessler was inundated with cards, offers of expensive purebred German shepherd and Belgian Malinois puppies as gifts, other new service dogs and thousands of messages of support on social media and news sites.

According to the U.S. War Dog Association, while individual military units may hold tributes for dogs lost in battle, Major Mike’s public funeral may be only the second of its kind in modern history. A dog that served in Iraq was buried with military honors last year in Michigan.

The local sheriff’s department concluded in an investigation completed late last week that the bicyclist, who said he had a revolver holstered to his bike so he could shoot deadly rattlesnakes in the area, believed he was defending his life and violated no laws. Bessler, 43, is contesting several aspects of the investigation’s findings.

In a news release, the Park County sheriff, Scott Steward, said, “This was a tragic situation for all those involved,” adding, “there are no winners here, only losers.”

The Army does not provide retired military working dogs with the same burial honors it does soldiers and veterans, although Bessler said he hoped Mike’s death would change that.

Mike’s headstone will be next to the plot Bessler has reserved for himself.",0.0,rallypoint first500

For example last night, I had a panic (or anxiety?) attack where I was overwhelmed with intense sadness and loneliness and crying uncontrollably. Then all of a sudden, nothing. I just stopped and felt *nothing*. Sometimes I purposely numb myself, but last night I didn’t even think I did it on purpose.

It’s such a strange feeling, because I think I even numb myself in daily life. If colleagues or friends are telling me about a sad event in their lives or a happy event, I don’t really feel much emotion and find myself having to fake it.

The Battle of Iwo Jima

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Iwo_Jima

The Battle of Iwo Jima (19 February – 26 March 1945) was a major battle in which the United States Marine Corps landed on and eventually captured the island of Iwo Jima from the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. The American invasion, designated Operation Detachment, had the goal of capturing the entire island, including the three Japanese-controlled airfields (including the South Field and the Central Field), to provide a staging area for attacks on the Japanese main islands.[4] This five-week battle comprised some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting of the War in the Pacific of World War II.

After the heavy losses incurred in the battle, the strategic value of the island became controversial. It was useless to the U.S. Army as a staging base and useless to the U.S. Navy as a fleet base.[6] However, Navy Seabees rebuilt the landing strips, which were used as emergency landing strips for USAAF B-29s.[7]

The Imperial Japanese Army positions on the island were heavily fortified, with a dense network of bunkers, hidden artillery positions, and 18 km (11 mi) of underground tunnels.[8][9] The American ground forces were supported by extensive naval artillery, and had complete air supremacy provided by U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aviators throughout the entire battle.[10]

Japanese combat deaths numbered three times the number of American deaths, although uniquely among Pacific War Marine battles, American total casualties (dead and wounded) exceeded those of the Japanese.[11] Of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima at the beginning of the battle, only 216 were taken prisoner, some of whom were captured because they had been knocked unconscious or otherwise disabled.[1] The majority of the remainder were killed in action, although it has been estimated that as many as 3,000 continued to resist within the various cave systems for many days afterwards, eventually succumbing to their injuries or surrendering weeks later.[1][12]

Despite the bloody fighting and severe casualties on both sides, the Japanese defeat was assured from the start. Overwhelming American superiority in arms and numbers as well as almost complete control of air power—coupled with the impossibility of Japanese retreat or reinforcement, along with sparse food and supplies—permitted no plausible circumstance in which the Americans could have lost the battle.[13]

Joe Rosenthal's Associated Press photograph of the raising of the U.S. flag on top of the 169 m (554 ft) Mount Suribachi by six U.S. Marines became an iconic image of the battle and the American war effort in the Pacific.

Dear Father, righteous judge of all mankind,




Help me to live as one upon whom the end of the ages has come. Help me take what happened to the Israelites as a warning to myself. Don't let me get puffed up, thinking that I can't fall. But at the same time let me keep in mind that no temptation has overtaken me that is not common to man. Help me remember that you are faithful and will not allow me to be tempted beyond my strength, but with every temptation will also provide the way for me to escape, that I may be able to endure it!

The way of escape may be death, as it was for Jesus. If so, may I be willing to die if that is what it takes to enter your eternal kingdom.

It is better that I should enter it with eyes or hands gone than to enter into hell with my whole body intact. Help me to obey you from a heart of love and gratefulness for what you have done for me.

In the name of Jesus grant me such love for you that I will persevere in obedience until the very end.

I don't know if this is a common thing, or even a thing, but for the last ten or so years I've had next to no sense of smell or taste, or at the least a VERY dull sense. I can't smell a burning candle a foot away, but can smell a candle if it's placed literally under my nose. Or I can't smell if the garbage needs taking out when other's might. I can't smell if something's burning in the oven, or if whatever I'm cooking even smells nice/horrible (As I've had the neighbors comment, but haven't been able to tell myself such as cooking aromatic curry.)

Then I have such a poor sense of taste that no matter what foods I cook, unless they're overly sweet or incredibly spicy, I can't really enjoy. If I make a burger I can't taste the distinction between beef and salad, maybe the cheese if it's overwhelmingly strong. If I make salad with a french vinagerette I can't taste the vinegar, or the salad, but I can still feel the sharpness of it on my tongue.

What makes this then even worse is that; a. I absolutely fucking love cooking, baking and making weird and unique things, but I can't taste any of them. And moreso, I still crave things I can't taste. I get no enjoyment from eating but still crave snacks and to eat nice dinners. I still fancy specific foods, but it's all bland in the mouth, so I've developed a horrendous habit of binge eating mundane things, popcorn, peanuts, corn snacks, crisps and entire loafs of bread.

5312,"Looking for advice/clarification about meds Hello all, I'm new to the sub and I've already learned some stuff about ADHD that I didn't know before. Thanks to all in advance, might be a longer post.

First off, I know I should be seeking medical advice from a qualified professional but with the American healthcare system being what it is I don't even know where to begin to start looking for said professional, let alone whether something like that is covered by my insurance.

I guess I'm looking for some help because my experience with meds hasn't been all that great but I see the majority of subs on here preaching that it's the best/only way to go which also seems to be backed up by what research I've done on my own. I tried Adderall 10 or 15mg (can't remember) when I was first diagnosed several years ago (I am 23M). It worked great at first but after taking it once a day for a couple weeks it seemed to ""wear off,"" not sure if I needed to up the dose or if that's normal and my body was just getting used to it. The main issue though, was the side effects. Once I took it, I had no appetite and couldn't eat for the rest of the day. I would crash in the evenings and get a bad headache and irritability. When I did eat, salty foods tasted very salty (like I was eating straight salt). It was really weird. So eventually I stopped taking it and went a few years unmedicated.

About a year ago, for my own sanity and my wife's, we decided to get me in to see a psychiatrist (I had since moved out of state). I told him about my previous experiences and he started me on 10mg Methylphenidate. From what I understand, this is a very low dose for this drug. The side effects were better and the meds were helping, but then they seemed to lose effectiveness again. And sometimes, these meds seemed to make my symptoms *worse* which I'm completely confused about. And there was a new side effect, my eyes had trouble focusing on things that were very close up or far away, almost like I was going a bit cross-eyed. I talked to my optometrist about it and she assured me that usually goes away after taking stimulants regularly for a couple weeks. Eventually it did, but the other side effects would get much worse whenever I upped the dose past 15mg (under professional advice and observation). And even when I took a 20mg dose it didn't seem to ""kick in"" until at least an hour, sometimes 2 and then it would wear off a couple hours later and I'd crash.

Sorry for the meandering post, I just... I guess I just don't see the point of the meds really. They don't seem to work well enough for me to justify the side effects. I know there are other drugs to try, should I keep looking? I have since stopped seeing that doctor, he didn't seem to be very up-to-date on best treatment practices for ADHD.

Also the job is at my old workplace in a different position, so there's also the anxiety of public failure. I would look like such a doofus if I was hired and then had to quit after a week or a month or something.

Yet I have felt like a change lately. Am I making a huge mistake thinking I can handle this?? Or should I apply for it and risk collapsing in on myself like a dying star?",1.0,reddit anxiety

4736,"What to do when meds are not an option I am a young mother with osteoporosis and my doctor confirmed all anxiety meds can cause a loss in bone mass, so it seems too risky to take them.

I have had anxiety and depression for 4 years now since my daughter had brain damage at birth due to a lack of oxygen. She survived and does mostly ok although she is different from her peers which causes me immense guilt and sorrow.

I feel like my anxiety is worsening instead of getting better with time and it's starting to get the best of me. I struggle to look normal when I interact with people at work or with my family while inside I feel a heavy weight of sadness, stress and guilt. I am easily overwhelmed by day to day tasks and I struggle to concentrate at work.

I have tried therapy for many months and it did help a little while I went, but it's difficult to keep paying for it continuously. So I have stopped for a few months and it seems I am now back to square one or worse.

I don't know what to do, I need to find something to help me because I feel very helpless and alone. My boyfriend tries to support me but he is also very affected by my negative emotions and can quickly become depressed himself when I confide in him, so I try to keep it to myself.

Also my anxiety and depression are very connected to feelings of guilt and unworthiness, so I don't know how I could do something like CBT. My therapists suggested it but I could not bring myself to want positive things or say positive things about myself. It seems there is something inside of me so angry with myself and with life I don't know how I could get beyond it and actually work to change my thought process. Can anyone relate?

3323,"Am I developing Schizophrenia? Should I check into a first episode clinic? Hello Everyone,

I have been struggling with a Schizophrenia anxiety for the past eight months, currently going through medication and therapy, which has helped tremendously. I was getting over this fear in mid September, when I realized I really shouldn't worry about developing the illness, as I am 22 years old, no family history, have a Vitamin D insufficiency that I am working to solve (a risk factor), been through some traumatic factors (dealt with a stalker in university, uncle's sudden death), lived independently in University, did an exchange in another country, and nothing has happened so far.

However today, I saw something that has me convinced I am developing Schizophrenia. In my room, my wall is quite discolored due to dirt being on it. I have visual snow, so seeing my wall along with the visual snow is a mindfuck of sorts. Anyways, I was just starting at the wall to see if I could see any shadows moving, since that is a sign of schizophrenia. I saw a stain on my wall, and as I went back, I saw it ""moving"", but when I went closer, it stopped ""moving"". The thing is, I am certain I was hallucinating or my brain was playing tricks on me. The stain is quite faint and my light is quite dim, but now I am certain I am developing psychosis. I even took a video of the stain to prove that I was hallucinating, in fact, I will upload it later.

Also ever since the anxiety started - after doing so much research on schizophrenia and schizophrenic delusions, I would get thoughts like ""This person is coming after me"" or ""Am I being followed?"". These thoughts give me great anxiety, and I keep telling myself reasons why those thoughts are not true. But I have done so much research that these thoughts now just come to me in the public, I keep going through the same repetitive disproving cycles.

I have seen five doctors (two therapists, two psychiatrists, one resident and one councillor) who said I was not schizophrenic and not in the prodormal phase. In fact, my latest evaluation was in August, and it mentioned that I had no signs of schizophrenia. I saw my psychiatrist as recently as two weeks ago and she said I wasn't schizophrenic, as well as my therapist who said I was not schizophrenic on Friday, and he was a resident in a schizophrenic ward for a year, so he knows his stuff. In fact, we did an exposure activity where he would mimick voices, and it was quite jarring, as well as one I pretended to be delusional, and it was hard - I couldn't act convincingly.

I started a job in SaaS sales about three months ago. It has been going well, and I do enjoy it, but it has been quite stressful as any other business job and now I am worried that the stress will cause me to develop schizophrenia and I am considering quitting this job and company that I enjoy because of this factor. Is this a wise idea?

From what I have said, should I go to the first episode clinic?",1.0,reddit anxiety

In high school everything was fine. I was always so busy and around teammates I never felt lonely or had time to think about it. Then came college. I got into a prestigious university and got a girlfriend and things seemed to be looking up. But I kept finding ways to screw myself over. A lot of days I couldn’t get myself to get up. A few times I failed classes just because I couldn’t find motivation to do the big semester assignment. This happened for four years and I somehow succeeded in passing three years worth of classes by only going to 20% of them, but I got permanently kicked out.

I lied to my parents about graduation. They found out. Luckily they didn’t disown me or anything after lying for over a year. It’s been two years now and I just got accepted back into a university, albeit an easier one. However, I have to pass these two classes at a junior college and I’m finding myself going into the same problems as before. I skip entire days of school just to lay in bed. My subconscious is yelling at myself to get up, but I just can’t, my body is unresponsive. Even when I’m really thirsty it can take me up to two or three hours just to get a glass of water.

So I have no idea what to call it but the best way to describe it is delayed decision making under stress. Like my mind might say “you should do xyz” but my body won’t cooperate and it’s like I’m literally paralyzed. XYZ could be anything. For example, I missed my bus stop yesterday (was used to other riders ringing the bell that when no one did i got caught off guard) and instead of simply getting off the next one, I sat inside the bus and passed maybe 3-4 stops to get off and find my way back to the train station. The whole time my brain was thinking, okay, I’m in a different town, I should get off at this next stop but how would I find my way back? Oh look, some kids from my school got off here I should have gotten off with them. Okay, when I do get off, do I order an uber or walk? We’re too far from the station for me to walk all the way back. Bla bla bla bla. Okay, I’m getting off at this stop.

I did eventually get off and found a subway line and made it safely to the train station, but the whole experience made me feel stupid. Like I could have avoided all that trouble if I had just gotten off at the next stop, but I didn’t react fast enough. Is this an anxiety thing? Or am I just slow? It was kindly pointed out by someone that at least I found a solution in the end even though it took me long enough to get there.

I don’t act like this all the time. Most of the time I don’t make mistakes and stay on top of things. Other times I get caught off guard and act like an idiot.

Bartenders became only friends. Started hanging with them while they're at work. Get free drinks from them. Continue to get free drinks from them. Restaurant I work for doesn't take inventory seriously and gives me an opportunity to steal beers and get away with it guaranteed. By 23 I was drinking between 8 and 16 beers a day with a few mixed drinks added in. By this time I blacked out occasionally puked weekly at least. Never let it effect my job, or hid it well enough. Now am 25, just moved to a new city and dont have those bartender friends. I've been here for 4 months now and have only puked/blacked out one time (new years) and have cut my intake to 4-8 beers a day, no hard liquor at all. That's just from moving to a better environment and not even trying. My issue is that I want to stop all together. I hate that I've let myself become this person, gain weight, act like a drunk idiot, and on and on. I dont smoke cigarettes or do other drugs outside alcohol and the occasional weed and I eat a moderately healthy diet so the only thing holding me back from what I want to be as far as health and awareness goes is alcohol.

I just want to stop. I've eased up but I want to work to be DONE. I have no (honest) alcoholics that I know well enough to talk to about this. What should I do/where should I go? Any ideas help, thank you for reading!",1.0,reddit alcoholism
3824,"Not On My Watch |body| I was sitting in a What-a-burger yesterday morning doing a Bible study with several other men.
Two gentlemen came in and grabbed a booth. One went to the counter to get some coffee and food, the other sat in the booth looking very distraught. And naturally, this caught my eye.
I went up to refill my coffee and ask the guy at the counter if everything was ok. Here is what he said:

""I am a cab driver. I went to pick someone up at the apartments across the street. I waited and waited, and no one ever came out. So I went and knocked on the door, and this guy (the one in the booth) opens the door. He is standing there holding a pistol. I asked if he ordered a cab and he said no. I asked what he was planning to do with the gun. He then proceeds to inform me that he is a veteran of OIF/OEF who is struggling in life as a civilian. He has no one, and he is better off dead.
I told him that I wasn't going to let that happen, and asked him for the gun. He gave it to me. I brought him here to get some food and we are headed to the VA hospital to get this brother some help. He isn't going to die today. NOT ON MY WATCH!""

The cab drivers name is Alvin, and he was a Vietnam era vet. The gentleman in the booth was Chris. I spoke with Alvin earlier today. Chris is resting at the VA hospital and receiving the care he needs.

Chris didn't call a cab. But for some reason Alvin showed up anyway. A veteran whom had chosen death over life has been given another chance, because someone said not today. Not on my watch.

I'm lonely.

I left the military.  It was terrible.  Being shafted and treated like dirt.  Having your life and future threatened by the stupidest rules imaginable.  And being treated like a child.  But it's the closest to family I've ever known.  Living in an apartment building with a hundred people you can talk to and call brother was nice.

I tried to be home, to be around blood family.  It reminded me why I left.  So I left there.

Now I've got a great job.  I've got a nice apartment.  I'm young and doing ""well"" for myself, but I don't feel like it.

I get no enjoyment out of work.  I'm either locked in a closet 12 hours a day or told how much I suck.  The ""friend"" that got me the job likes to remind me that he hates me and that I'm worthless.  My only positive interaction is with my booty call.  That's fallen through after she gave me an STI.  No one else wants to talk to me.  Even my friends from the military ignore me now.

The VA is useless.  I have to wait 6 months to see a therapist.  They want to push happy pills on me.  I feel like that would make me a banana.

Then, all the ‘also ran’ Dem Presidential candidates ooze out of the woodwork to jump on that doomed bandwagon on mandatory weapon ‘buy backs’.  And don’t think they will just stop with ‘assault weapons’, ... they want them ALL  !!!

I’ve been dealing with anxiety for 3 years now and as a student, somehow, due to being on “high alert” at all times, I’ve somehow gotten better at picking up hints and body language of other people.

It’s probably because of the ‘adrenaline’ from being anxious or trying to read them to avoid them, but somehow I find it a lot easier to read people nowadays, their emotions and what they show from their body language.

I also listen to music a lot especially in public transport in places due to getting very anxious in crowded places and using it to calm myself down and avoid anxiety attacks, and I just realised today while ordering a drink from a bubble tea place (waiting to collect my drink with my earphones in) when a woman came up to me (I don’t think she knew I had earphones in as I have wireless ones that are very hard to see as my hair usually covers them) and made some motions with her hand. My brain somehow got her intention right, which was to ask how to order a drink. I was then able to carry on the conversation normally! (First time I’ve done it without messing up!)

I don’t know if you guys have that, but I think that because of the constant state of anxiety and being anxious of what people are going to scold me/how they think of me(i’m Still trying to correct not being so dependent of that :/) and trying to correct that in advance without directly asking them, I’ve developed a niche for reading people.

I didn’t “ghost” anyone really.. I made several post about how I was deleting old classmates, old friends and acquaintances included before I went ahead and cleared out the app and just continued on. There were a couple people I felt bad for deleting off of there, but also reasoned that if they wanted to talk or check in on me (my mental health issues were a secret to no one) they’d check on me and all that, especially because I’m on instagram (though not currently active).



I’m interested in logging back onto social media due to being a film major and wanting to be able to promote my work going forward into my first year at uni as a junior, but feel a twinge of shame and embarrassment when I see everyone I use to know or talk too occasionally that I just dropped off on.

4038,"Found something to hold onto I saw a post on here that had a picture of a sign from a Unitarian Universalist church. I really liked what it said, stuff about acceptance, equal rights, etc. So I looked it up and found the official website. After reading about it &amp; doing some research, I found a location in my city. I looked at their website &amp; read about things they do. I feel like this is a place I need to go because I am at a really difficult place in my life. Things ended with this great guy because he wanted to work on himself, I quit my job because it was too emotionally &amp; physically taxing, and my therapist decided that it’s time I have my first therapy appointment with my mom. Which is a HUGE thing because she abused me most of my childhood and it really fucked me up. Not to mention that I’ve barely spoken to her in the past few years.
Because I’m going to start working on my relationship with her, I’ve had to take a step back from my dad. He basically hates her because of the way she treated me(he didn’t find out until I told him at 18), and I don’t need his negativity in my life. Not to mention that he can be toxic because he has bipolar but denies it.
So basically, I’ve got nothing going on in my life and have very little control of things. I don’t really have any friends, at least ones that I can visit.
The only problem is that I can’t drive and the church isn’t accessible by bus. I don’t have a job so I can’t pay for an uber. And before you ask how I’m able to survive with no job, it’s because I have an amazing grandpa who’s been taking care of me until I’m able to support myself, along with still being on my mom’s insurance and my dad paying for my phone bill.
I don’t know how I’m going to be there. It’s frustrating because not being able to drive has always been such a barrier for me.

Hello all!

New here, new throwaway too. I was diagnosed with CPTSD in 2013, and since then my symptoms have remained the same. However, in the last 6 months or so I've begun seeing 'faceless' people-- as in, people who have heads and hair but their faces are featureless. It looks like they just have flat skin instead of having eyes, eyebrows, etc.

When I see them I don't feel fear, and sometimes I see them in passing but there have been a few times in which I've been in a store and seen the same faceless person walking around a few times.

DAE experience this, or something similar? I don't think my other diagnoses would be the cause of this (ye olde depression, bipolar, anxiety) because I've had those since I was much younger and those symptoms haven't changed on me either.

In some respects the VA is better suited to my TBI & PTSD. My issue is if my VA rep can get me into the right treatments its a big win. However I might ask to be assigned someone else.  I am well aware my filters and perceptions are damaged so I TRY to have someone else present for issues and then ask and evaluate ""Was my perceptions correct? Am I appropriate in my observations?"" So in this case I had my wife attend. What I WANTED was more feedback from my wife to the VA rep, as well as my wife to Evaluate my perceptions of the VA rep.

2454," |body| Today's Scripture is from Hebrews 9:27



“& as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment”--Hebrews 9:27. As no wisdom, learning, virtue, wealth, or power, can keep us from death, so nothing can deliver a sinner from being condemned at the Day of Judgment, except the atoning sacrifice of Jesus. No one will be saved from eternal punishment that despises or neglects this great salvation. Death is a reality for every member of the human race.

Much too often we fail to realize that death is in the natural sequence of events for man. For unsaved men, after death there's nothing but judgment. If the death of Christ doesn't save you, there's nothing ahead of you but judgment. Death isn't  appointed unto all men—thank God for that. It is appointed to men once to die, but some are not going to die. I hear people talk today about old age & oh, how they want to die & get into the presence of God. I don’t know about you, but I don’t mind waiting. I’m in no hurry to die! I hope I can live until He comes. I don’t know whether I will, but that's the way I would like it.

The people that choose not to follow Jesus are many times those who think that: “I’m a good person.” “I don’t hurt anyone.” “I try to be kind to everyone.” We go from that extreme to: “I don’t believe in nothing that can’t be proven through science” (atheist) & those who are religious but not spiritual. Thus both reincarnation & the belief that physical death is the end of personal existence are excluded. Christ suffered the common human destiny of death & judgment however; for Him the judgment consisted in resurrection & vindication. This vindication will be fully manifested when He comes again.

Today I exhort you to realize that we all are going to die & face judgment. It happens to us daily, in many ways & for many reasons, But whatever the form, we all experience judgment. God's fair & just! He wants everyone to know Him & be forgiven but not everyone will follow Him. We who trust Christ as Savior don’t need to fear judgment. His death has made forgiveness certain. If you’re not a Christian, trust Jesus as your Savior today & you can have peace in the face of judgment too.


Through the eternal Spirit He offered Himself to God!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If we now take my Pun into account, it will state: ""If he leaves good, kill him."". This is how we should decypher the bible. Configure Synonyms for what was said based upon the Knowledge of "" What would Good, without emotion mean?"". If God exists and has no emotion, since he is nothing, has no rules and therefore can create something, every thought is something and he has no Memory. No rules mean infinite thinking speed. This means he never begins, he only ends. So he ended everything all at once. He could.

Sometimes I open my computer to write a cover letter and I just freeze. The hardest part by far for me though is asking for references. I got a list of people who agreed to speak on my behalf a long time ago but this process has taken so long that it makes me feel like such a loser to say ""Hey, I'm still looking for a job and I'm doing interviews and they might call you to ask about me"" so long after I've asked them to help me. But I made progress in some interviews processes so I had to do it. I had to contact them.

I was so worried they'd think I'm a loser too. That they'd rescind their offer to help me...but they didn't! They all responded telling me they were happy to hear from me and they hoped things were going well for me.

Normally, I'd think ""hope things are going well"" was patronizing or condescending...but this time I decided to stick to the facts:

- These are people who hired me before.

- These are people who told me they'd help me when I asked them to.

- These are people who took the time to respond to my messages and expressed that they enjoyed hearing from me and that they cared about me.

Instead of coming up with insane conspiracy theories, I took emotion out of the situation and looked at the facts. As I did, I wondered why I always exaggerate the negative possibilities in a situation. Why can't I do that with the positive ones? Instead of thinking that my references think I'm a sad loser who probably has something wrong with them, why don't I think that my references consider e-mails from me a pleasant surprise from a former employee who was good at her job?

3746,"- Do I know personally any gang members? No but I can read. I can read reports of them stating that recruitment has gone up because of the immigration policies. Why? Because people are scared to report when they get attacked by MS-13 because they are undocumented. So what is their only recourse? To be silent and probably to join them - or die. Am I an expert on the gang? No but I have a basic understanding of them.

I fail to see where I EVER said that ""anything"" with MS-13 is ""funny."" Please point me to the statement I made because I'm looking at my comment and I didn't say ANYTHING like that. Not one damn thing. I never said MS-13 is funny. I said that it's funny for people to say that Trump's immigration policies are hurting the gang when in fact they are not. I NEVER SAID THE GANG OR THE SITUATION IS FUNNY! That's something a lot of people say. So if you want to play the semantics game with me, please private message me. I could play that game all day.

I know what they do and how they do it. But when they have put out statements saying that and when anonymous victims say ""we can't do anything to stop them because we are undocumented"" then YES the immigration policy IS helping the gang recruit.

7567,"Tardive Dyskinesia, medication adjustments and the manic aftermath. Hi everyone,

It’s hard to know where to start. I started medication for bipolar as an adolescent (13 I think) but I have been bipolar since I was a young child, and it feels like there is nothing before it. I am entering my late twenties now (so still young) but as you may know even in my childhood there was a lot of controversy about whether children could be bipolar and very little known about medicating children for being bipolar. I did have a child psychiatrist and I sincerely believe he did the best he could for me. That being said, everything was sort of a stab in the dark. I am sure there are many of you who can relate.

It turns out that a good psychiatrist is hard to find around here, so the next one I went to missed a medication interaction between a non psychiatric medication I was already on and lamictal. He also happened to miss my signs of tardive dyskinesia even though I brought them to his attention several times. I no longer see him. I am no longer on lamictal.

I now see a new psychiatrist and she is fantastic. I am in good hands and trust that, but she had to bring me down from a fairly standard dose of Abilify I have been on for the past 14 years to basically almost nothing because of the tardive dyskinesia. I was fine at first, surprisingly fine and stable, but now I have been manic/hypomanic for a couple of weeks when I was pretty well managed before.

I see my psychiatrist in three days. I plan to talk to her and come up with a plan to deal with this at that appointment.

It’s just at my last appointment, before the mania started, we talked about my choices and my medication options are now limited based on what did not work for me before and especially now thanks to developing TD and I am just scared. There may be some major changes to my medication.

I have started this amazing life with this amazing girl. I have a stable job. We are getting married next year. We have a home. We have cats. We have a future. We want kids. I am scared because although she has seen me in bad moments and knows of my past, she has not truly experienced me at my worst. I know she will always love me but I am terrified- terrified of the td getting worse. Terrified of feeling out of control again.

I don’t really know what I expect from any comments. I suppose I just needed to say this to people who would understand how I feel. Most people I know and talk to don’t get it at all. They have not lived it. I needed to confide in people who struggle with what I struggle with.

It’s like my life that I worked so hard to build and maintain since I was a child (with consistent therapy, with medication, and with A LOT of everyday effort) is going to be ripped out from under me and it’s not even my doing. I did everything right. It hurts. It’s scary. It’s a lot.

I am a student and I don't have a job, I live at home. I typically take one, maybe two classes at a time. This summer I am taking a class, and while it is just the one, summer classes are much more intense than I'm accustomed to. Instead of meeting twice a week, it meets four days in a row. I've only done two weeks of it and already my health feels like it is declining. I have no appetite and I can't concentrate on anything at all for more than a few minutes. I spend so long just staring into space every day. I have no energy to do anything. I keep misplacing things and I am so out of it I'm messing up on simple tasks.

It's reminding me of a few years ago, I took a year off school and I helped then girlfriend move to my state, and then I helped her care for her child full time and took her to the grocery store or appointments. Nearly every day we would have to go out and do something, and if not then I was still taking care of the kiddo. I started getting very nauseous and would throw up multiple times a day. I had to get a daily medicine for it but I feel like it had to have been caused by me being so busy.

Even though I'm not doing even as much as average really, it impacts my health so much. I want to be able to do as much as everybody else and have a normal job/life. It doesn't feel like it should be as hard as it is.

I don't know exactly what is causing all this or if it's a combination of things, or something else even, but I am probably autistic and I have an anxiety disorder. (I started to get a diagnosis for autism and it was narrowed down to either autism, schizophrenia, or a sensory processing disorder but the person diagnosing me moved suddenly and I never received my results even though I went through the entire process. I do believe autism is the right diagnosis though.)

I'm just wondering if anyone else goes through this and if you have managed to cope with it somehow.

997," |body| Chuck Yeager Breaks the Sound Barrier by Bill Bennett and John Cribb
Until October 14, 1947, no one knew if a plane could fly faster than the speed of sound. Aircraft approaching Mach 1 shook violently, as if hitting an invisible wall. Only a year earlier, British pilot Geoffrey De Havilland had died when his plane broke apart flying close to the speed of sound. Scientists theorized that as a plane reached high speeds, sound waves piled up around it, creating a “sound barrier” that held it back.

After World War II the U.S. military and Bell Aircraft developed the X-1, a “bullet with wings” designed to punch a hole through the sound barrier. The test pilot for the rocket-powered plane was 24-year-old Captain Chuck Yeager. A decorated combat ace, Yeager had cheated death more than once. During the war, he’d been shot down over France but eluded the Nazis with the help of the French Resistance, made it back to his squadron, and returned to the skies.

By mid-October 1947 Yeager had flown the X-1 several times over the Mojave Desert, edging closer to the sound barrier. On October 14 he climbed into the plane with two cracked ribs from a fall off a horse – an injury he kept secret so he wouldn’t be grounded. A giant B-29 carried the X-1 to 20,000 feet and released it. The plane stalled and dropped 500 feet while Yeager struggled to bring it under control. He fired his rocket engines, climbed to 42,000 feet, leveled off, and fired a rocket again.

Then it happened. The shaking suddenly stopped. “I was so high and so remote, and the airplane was so very quiet that I might have been motionless,” Yeager later recalled. But the needle on the speed gauge jumped off the scale. On the ground below, engineers heard the thunder of a sonic boom. Chuck Yeager had punched through the sound barrier.

A little context, I am a paramedic and have been working on completing a degree. I just had to do a research paper on mental illness and decided on PTSD since those in my field have seen some shit, myself included. I was prepared for that going into the job.

What I was not prepared for, was in doing research learning that an experience I had many years ago has caused so many problems I thought where just weird modest quirks I have. 5 years ago an ex sexually exploited me with revenge porn and attempted to have people gang rape me. I was never physically hurt, but it was a horrible time. I have had to deal with random strangers sending me the photos my ex secretly took as well as people using the photos to pretend to be me and gotten some creepy messages. He also added my phone number to a “call for phone sex” website.

I hate talking about this, I don’t like anyone taking photos of me that could be suggestive at all and even if it happens accidentally I get so scared I can’t breathe. It makes me incredibly uncomfortable to dress in any form that is revealing and I’ve realized this is causing problems with my current SO, who is an amazing and understanding individual.

I finally sat down with my SO and discussed what happened to me. He said he has known for awhile I’m having problems, and described some other times I’ve had flashbacks of sorts and didn’t even realize. He is a paramedic as well.

I think my initial descent into depression started the day I returned to San Francisco from Ft. Lewis after being discharged.  My disappointment in the American people was beyond my wildest expectations.  An expectation of at least a neutral reception was dashed in just a few seconds.  After three years in the Army, returning home at the end of 1970 I had fully anticipated some respect for having served my country. My mind, spirit and emotional self-rejected all of the negativity, yet I could not escape it.  A feeling of shame descended upon me. I suppose that over the years, aided by alcohol, I learned to ""deal"" with these feelings, I learned to ""dumb-down"" and go on my merry way.  Somewhere along the line, I slipped into a depressed placed yet denied I suffered from depression.  Although I stopped drinking in 1985 the progression of depression continued.  What was ""clinical depression?"" I had no idea, I really had no idea that I was indeed suffering from depression.  Sometime early the 2000's I became overwhelmed and had to finally admit that I was, indeed, depressed and needed help.  It took suicidal ideation to convince me that something needed to be done and that I was depressed.

We had a relationship that was full of the absolute purest and most powerful love, but the alcoholism sometimes made things unclear. She would become very angry when drunk, and accuse me of not loving her, which in turn would push me away.

2731,"""Shut up. You don't have PTSD."" \-- Is what my brother said to me about a year ago. I didn't know how to argue because 1. He spent a large chunk of my childhood in the same house as me and was unaware of how things were actually going for me, and 2. I wasn't actually diagnosed.  I knew that I couldn't argue it, or even know for sure that that's what I was struggling with, without a diagnosis. So, I quietly shamed myself for speaking out and moved on.

&amp;#x200B;

Welp. On Monday, I asked my therapist if she had diagnosed me with anything. She asked, ""Would you like to be diagnosed with something?"" and I told her that I just wanted to figure out why I feel so on-the-outside/different from other people. I've always called it, ""constantly feeling alone in a crowded room."" She calls it ""disassociation."" I've obviously heard this term before, but had no idea that was what I was referring to, makes sense now. I thought we would go through a few things to see what I may have, but she went straight to PTSD, which was a bit alarming for me. I instantly heard my brothers words in my head. ""Shut up. You don't have PTSD."" And as we went through the questions and discussion, I heard his words in my head again and again. When we finally finished, she informed me that I do, in fact, have PTSD. I was just kind of like... ""Oh. Okay."" and there came that emotional numbness I'm so fond of.

2987,"While going through tough times I happened to read ""Life After Life"" by Raymond Moody which was written by a doctor about patients that had died and had been resuscitated, and what they said about the experience afterwards. Most of the experiences were positive and the people were no longer afraid of death.

But in the back of the book were cases of suicide in which the people were trying to escape painful lives and they just wanted the pain to end. Unfortunately for them, the pain and anguish only increased in the next life.

That gave me the determination to deal with my rough times, because I didn't want them to just get worse.

And, please, everyone, never, EVER think that your suffering is unworthy compared to any other service member, veteran or civilian. YOU are worthy, they are worthy. Our demons are our demons and theirs are theirs. We should not be judging the validity or severity of their suffering, or our own. That's how people die. PTSD is an injury. A physical injury -- our brains are structurally changed and our body chemistry is not the same, either. We now know that stress our mothers might have experienced while carrying us in their wombs may have affected us. Her body chemistry was OURS, too. PTSD isn't limited to the military. You're not alone, and you're not abnormal. At some point in time, we'll all experience at least one traumatic event -- and prolonged stress of any kind can be just as bad. Take care of YOU!

1280,"Anxiety about getting a cold virus - please help... Okay, I know this is going to sound stupid because a lot of people here have concerns about serious illnesses, but I seem to be stressing about the common cold. I'm not sure if this belongs here (sorry if it doesn't) because this is my first time experiencing anxiety of this kind. I have struggled with anxiety since as long as I can remember, and I have the kind of brain that will latch on to a certain worry or situation and obsess over it until it becomes debilitating.

These kinds of obsessions have arisen about a lot of things over my life, but never particularly about germs or about my health. However, around a week ago I started feeling cold symptoms and have spent the last week fighting off a cold virus - a relatively mild one compared to some other colds I've had - and it affected me the way colds always do; a whole week of feeling miserable and sleeping badly because my symptoms keep me awake. In all other cases, though, when I feel my cold clearing up I just allow myself to be happy about it and then I move on with my life.

But it's been different this time. I think it's because the timing of the cold was terrible. I was literally days away from finishing my exams when the symptoms first started, and I had been looking forward to being able to relax, sleep well, and be happy once my exams were over for *weeks*. So, when it finally came to that day and I felt like shit because I had a cold, it was really upsetting for me and I just felt exhausted. Life has been really rough for so long and the fact that I got a virus at the final hurdle just felt cruel. So, this cold has affected my mental state especially negatively even though the symptoms have been comparatively wild.

That said, yesterday morning I was in a pretty good mood because I felt certain my symptoms were almost gone and I was on the mend, so I decided to go home for the weekend to visit my family. I was relaxed until I got to the train station, and whilst sitting in the waiting room before my connecting train, a lady sitting across from me coughed. She covered her mouth, but only partially. I immediately got up and left the waiting room, but since then I have been obsessing about the fact that I might have picked up another cold virus. This is my search history from the past 24 hours alone: [https://imgur.com/wB1uXhz](https://imgur.com/wB1uXhz). I still have some lingering symptoms from my cold, such as a mild cough, some excess mucus (even though I didn't have much nasal congestion this time around), and a slightly dry throat. Since the woman coughed near me, I have been obsessively imagining that my symptoms are getting worse, and they're not the end of this cold but rather the start of another one. Or that even if these current symptoms do get better, it will be but a day or two before the new virus presents itself and I have to go through the whole thing again. I think it has gotten to the point where I have convinced myself that I cannot be happy or relaxed like I imagined I would be until I am physically healthy, so the thought of getting a second cold has transformed into the worst thing imaginable, rather than a disappointing inconvenience.

I've been compulsively washing and disinfecting my hands. I keep administering nasal sprays that are supposed to disable cold viruses before I even know if I have another. And I'm painfully aware of how irrational it is. I know that I come into contact with viruses and bacteria every day of my life, and I rarely get sick from it. I know that the woman might not have had a cold, but just allergies or something stuck in her throat. I know that even if I did breathe in an airborne virus, I might already be immune to it or it might not give me any symptoms. I know that getting another cold, whilst upsetting, would only be temporary. But, as is always the case with my anxiety, my logical brain is simply unable to overpower the obsessive worrying, so things end up spiralling into something far bigger than they need to be.

I have enough debilitating anxieties in my life. I don't want germophobia or hypochondria to be added to that list. But this kind of obsession is always how they start, and I just cannot stop myself from worrying. It's mentally exhausting. Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation? Can anyone offer any reassurance about the chances of me having another cold? I just want to be able to enjoy my life without having to worry about this.

TL;DR: I've only just had a cold and now I'm scared I have another, which would be distressing for me because my brain is blowing the situation out of proportion. Does anyone have any advice for dealing with this?",1.0,reddit healthanxiety

PO2, I'm sorry you lived in your car for 2 years; that would thankfully never be me because I do have friends and family that will support me in any way possible.  As far as not having the niceties, selling my belongings isn't going to fix the problem.  The only real solution is find a job.

Want to know what happened when I came on here looking for networking opportunities?  Members told me to go to USAJobs.gov.  People genuinely think they are being helpful by giving advice like this.  I got one genuine offer for help the last time I was on here asking my fellow veterans about transitioning.  One.  That was months ago.

You do not know my situation (which was obvious when you brought my back injury into this), and you don't know what I've been doing and what I've done to find a job, any job.  And nobody seems to understand how getting a minimum wage job still leaves me with the inability to pay ALL of my bills, making it so my credit is still going to get destroyed, which is the actual issue here.  Fantastic, if I take home $1000 a month, spend $50 of that on a cheap cellphone (because I need any phone to get a job), and don't spend my money on anything else but my student loans, I still can't pay all of my student loans, and losing my car and my apartment has also devastated my credit.  And whichever student loan I am choosing to ignore, has already defaulted to my mother (co-signer), devastating not just my credit, but hers  as well.

A minimum job is not the answer.  No matter what, I'm not going to starve and I'll have a roof over my head.  But if I'm not able to all of my bills, then the credit of two people is going to get destroyed, I can say goodbye to my security clearance, and I can say goodbye to any of the jobs I'm applying for, as they all perform a credit check (particularly the global financial institutions I've been applying for).

One person here actually gave me the ridiculous response of ignoring my student loans.  I'm guessing the military doesn't have the requirement to read, or maybe just a general understanding of how the world works.  Yes, destroy my credit and my co-signers credit.  Just give up.

I've got professional lessons booked in starting next week, but am tempted to cancel them and give up on this whole thing. It just feels overwhelming and paying someone for an hour lesson feels so out of reach. I don't want to have a panic attack on a professional instructor.

Does anyone have any advice? When does this get easier? Is it just worth quitting?",1.0,reddit anxiety

8402,"I have given reasons for my vote downs. If you felt I did not, please be more specific I could have missed one although I don't give them out often. On the opposite side I have been voted down here by several people who didn't so much as make a comment at all let alone one addressing their need to come in here and vote me down.

Look, I grew up in a town where people (grown adults) actually play little high school mind games with their friends when one person that's popular (or thinks they are anyways) just doesn't like someone, I used to get bullied by kids my own age simply because I was smarter than the average kid and was placed in advanced classes since the 1st grade, it didn't matter that the older kids liked me either.

 So I have some immunity to this kind of tactic and I can see it from a mile away, not that I'm making accusations here but to be clear I am not the issue here and I will stand my ground because I am not responsible for how people choose to respond to me. That is entirely an issue of personal responsibility.

I also don't get bent out of shape simply because people disagree either, disagreements happen and personally I think what's really wrong with our country is that people today are so divided by relatively petty differences (in comparison to what we all have in common the differences are very small) that they won't reach across the aisle. What's important isn't agreeing 100% with each other it's being willing to examine and discuss the issues respectfully and work to find solutions together.

You can't expect that from others when you don't do it yourself and it's impossible to have a meaningful discussion when people have the audacity to tell you that your facts (however factual in nature) are wrong because they don't agree.

If you can try and level with me here, I come from a very large and diverse family that has played many different roles large and small in the development of our country, all the members of my family that live today have historical connections where there are valuable lessons to be learned in the most pressing issues that face Americans today, if people want to get caught up in petty arguments that's on them.

Life in Christ
“In him was life; and the life was the light of men.” (John 1:4)

A host of biochemists and other scientists have tried for over a century to determine how life evolved from non-life. Such a quest is absurdly impossible, for the simplest imaginary self-replicating system would be infinitely more complex than the most elaborate machine ever designed by man. Life can come only from life. The first human life, indeed the first living system of any kind, could only have come by special creation from the living God. “For I am fearfully and wonderfully made” (Psalm 139:14).

Thus, “in him we live, and move, and have our being,” and He is “not far from every one of us” (Acts 17:28, 27). The Lord Jesus Christ is the one “by whom also he made the worlds” and who now is “upholding all things by the word of his power” (Hebrews 1:2-3). The beating of our hearts, the breathing of our lungs, the very atoms of our bodies are continually sustained by Him. Were He to withdraw His power for a moment, life would cease and all light would become darkness. Even those who reject Him and blaspheme His name owe their very existence to His power and grace.

“As the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself” (John 5:26). Life is “in him”; He alone can conquer death and raise the dead. “As the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will” (v. 21), for as “the first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit” (1 Corinthians 15:45).

Thus, “he that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life” (1 John 5:12). Through faith in His sacrificial death and resurrection life, “ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.” Henceforth is Christ Himself “our life” (Colossians 3:3-4).

I used to have cripplingly severe anxiety, peaking at about 2016/17. I still experience the effects but i have learned to cope, however,  i just wish to share things that when on in 2016/17 that I never spoke to medical professionals about at the time.

During 16/17 my anxiety levels were unexplainable. I would experience symptoms that to this day i debate if they were in fact symptoms of anxiety or if they are something else underlying.

1. During mornings (only mornings idk why) I would hear voices when alone. I could have full conversations with a voice in my head, which would just usually talk about very mundane daily things, but all the same.

2. I would experience hallucinations. Very vivid hallucinations. Usually spiders in full detail to the point it was 100% lifelike in my mind yo the point it was indistinguishable from reality.But alo then the usual hallucinations of colours, visual snow and people etc.

3. I would also experience very unsettling mental thoughts constantly. One being the constant image that my brain was made of teeth (?). I have no idea. But i remember it to this day and it makes me feel sick. This 1 just one of many but you get the picture.

These 3 were compunded with the usual daily (multiple) panic attacks and crippling anxiety but i feel they may have been an indication of something else. I do not experience these 3 effects anymore, I could go into a lot more detail but I would like responses and dont want to bore anyone lol. Thanks x",1.0,reddit anxiety

I remember getting the bread down from on top of the fridge and putting my 2 slices in the toaster, then my boyfriend walked in the kitchen and started rubbing my back. I ""snapped out of it"" at his touch and saw everything done. As he was walking out the door, I asked if something was written on his sandwich (the sharpie was by the toaster, not its usual spot) and he said ""Yeah, a heart. Why?"" So I told him I didn't remember doing any of that. He said I was probably just still waking up, and not to worry myself too much. But I'd been up since 4ish (this was at 6:30-ish).

It's happened to me before, but mostly kind of going ""on autopilot"" while driving, and only realizing I'm at my destination when trying to park, or blank staring at the wall/floor while watching TV or talking to someone (or rather listening to them talk).

On Tuesday, September 11, 2001, nineteen al-Qaeda terrorists, mostly from Saudi Arabia, hijacked four commercial jetliners and turned them into flying bombs. Two of the hijacked planes slammed into the 110-story twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. Americans watched their TV screens in horror as the two skyscrapers, among the tallest in the world, collapsed. Another plane hit the Pentagon, and the fourth jet crashed in rural Pennsylvania.

Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks, including more than 400 firefighters, police officers, and emergency medical services workers who had rushed to the World Trade Center to help survivors before the buildings fell.

Among the day’s heroes were passengers on board United Flight 93, which had left Newark International Airport for San Francisco but changed course toward Washington, D.C., after four terrorists seized control. Passengers who began making frantic calls on their cell phones learned that other airliners had been hijacked and crashed in suicide missions. Realizing their captors must be headed toward a high-profile target, a group of Flight 93 passengers resolved to stop them.

Passenger Todd Beamer told an operator that he and a few others were going to jump the hijackers. “Are you guys ready?” the operator heard him say to someone. “Let’s roll!”

Moments later, Flight 93 went down in rural southwestern Pennsylvania. All aboard were killed. The hijackers’ target was probably the U.S. Capitol building or the White House.

Congress and the president have designated September 11 as Patriot Day. The flag should be flown at half-staff, and Americans are asked to observe a moment of silence to honor the innocent victims who perished during the worst acts of terrorism ever carried out against the United States.

I was in and out back before the term PTSD had not been thought of,  I mean they didn't call it that, and this was during VN 1967/68/69 time frame.  However, to me it was like I was on fire and I couldn't put it out or get any relief.
I was at that time an 0311 assigned to A 1/9 Marines and fought on Hill 64 at Khe Sanh, where my Platoon was over run (64) Marines by an estimated battalion size of NVA.  They broke our lines and we fought hand to hand, I along with others were 18 years old.
So, my point is............I have seen the worse!  Getting (mentally) thru life with that monkey on my back was pure hell!  Especially at that age too.  And I did try too.............got way out there on the edge of ""life""............lost myself a few times trying too.
Finally after about four years of that I went back on active duty, I had a four year break.  From that point, I knew deep down that if I was going to make anything of myself or a life for myself it was going to take pure self initiative, I mean I had to walk a fine line due to the added weight I felt.  Now it was trial and error I didn't start out being that way, it was a struggle.  But I did it!  I did it without crutches of any sort.  If I had a relapse the blame went to me...........I blamed no one, not even the reasons why I felt this added weight, or the monkey on my back, I blamed myself.  Because I knew deep down it was going to take ""me"" alone to get from Point A to Point B.  So, I did not accept nor do I to this day accept a problem like PTSD having anything to do with my life.  As a twenty four year veteran who served in VN and Desert Storm I guess I could be drawing disability for PTSD like a lot of other veterans do............but I refuse..............
Combat is something that you will take to your grave with you...........you're not going to forget it.  The best we can hope for is the ability to live with it and have a quality life.

And B) you have been trying hard to get back to the amazing human you are today and people fail to see that you could be like that (which is dumb af for me to think of) This has been an issue that has pressed heavy in the last year. I’ve been trying to take a new step ( scary asl one of you ask me) and make some new good friends. Obviously these are people who don’t have a problem with drugs or alcohol the ways I did and do. My drug counselor gave me this challenge and I can honestly say idk wtf she was thinking. I’ve been trying to see that “light”. But damn just trying to stay clean was already enough. NOW IM AROUND PEOPLE WHO EITHER DONT FUCKING GET IT AND THINK ONE WONT HURT. OR FORCED TO BE AROUND PEOPLE WHO ARE THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF ME AND IT DISGUSTS ME. Like I said I’m TRYING to find the light in this. But I keep finding myself become more isolated than I was trying to get clean. I always love sharing my story and my life with people. I mean I am a open book and somehow it always helps me in the end. But as I have gotten older I have grown to realize that people also have their own shit &amp; that they might not really be listening to everything I am telling them or grasping how much a problem it was because on the outside I look ok now. Idk it just becomes more and more discouraging. I’ve also found myself becoming triggered like I was when I was trying to get clean!!!!

It scares tf out of me. I’ve been strong but I’m finding myself back at a place I tried so hard to forget about. I’ve been reading my young sober and free book a lot but I guess I just need to know if anyone went through this and how? Much love to us all",1.0,reddit addiction

Suicides among active-duty soldiers are up about 20 percent
By:  Meghann Myers

(PIC) Army suicides were up in 2018 for active-duty soldiers, though total Army numbers dipped slightly. (Tech. Sgt. Matt Hecht/Air Force)


The Army reported an uptick in active-duty suicides in 2018, according to service statistics, though deaths by suicide were slightly down in the total force.


Out of 303 total reports, 138 came from the active-duty side ― 22 more than in 2017, Defense Department statistics show.


“Like the rest of America, the Army continues to grapple with the loss of too many of our people to suicide,"" Army spokeswoman Col. Kathleen Turner told Army Times in a statement Friday. “The loss of any soldier or Army family member to suicide is a tragedy.”


The most recent DoD quarterly suicide report goes back to 2012, showing a six-year high of 325 total suicides in the Army. That number dropped to 300 in 2013 and then to a low of 245 in 2014, before ramping back up to 279 in both 2015 and 2016, then jumping again to 303 in 2017.


During that time, active-duty numbers also fluctuated. The Army reported 165 active-duty suicides in 2012, which dropped to 121 in 2013, then 126 in 2014 and 120 in 2015. The past three years, the numbers have swelled and dipped from 120 in 2016 to 116 in 2017, then back up to 138.

“While the Army has made progress, more work needs to be done,” Turner said.


Meanwhile, the Marine Corps reported its highest suicide numbers in a decade, at 75. According to Military.com, total active-duty reports across the four DoD services are the highest they’ve been since 2012, which had been the DoD services' worst year since it began centrally tracking reports in 2001.


“We must continue to ensure commanders have the policies and resources they need to prevent suicides, that all leaders have the tools to identify soldiers who are suffering and to positively intervene, and that all soldiers view seeking mental health care as a sign of strength,” Turner said.

Divine Escape

Bible in a Year:
1 Chronicles 10–12; John 6:45–71


So from that day on they plotted to take his life.

John 11:53

comment

Today's Scripture & Insight:
 John 11:45-53

Agatha Christie’s Hercule Poirot mystery The Clocks features antagonists who commit a series of murders. Although their initial plot targeted a single victim, they began taking more lives in order to cover up the original crime. When confronted by Poirot, a conspirator confessed, “It was only supposed to be the one murder.”

Like the schemers in the story, the religious authorities formed a conspiracy of their own. After Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead (John 11:38–44), they called an emergency meeting and plotted to kill Him (vv. 45–53). But they didn’t stop there. After Jesus rose from the dead, the religious leaders spread lies about what happened at the grave (Matthew 28:12–15). Then they began a campaign to silence Jesus’s followers (Acts 7:57–8:3). What started as a religious plot against one man for the “greater good” of the nation became a web of lies, deceit, and multiple casualties.

Sin plunges us down a road that often has no end in sight, but God always provides a way of escape. When Caiaphas the high priest said, “It is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish” (John 11:50), he didn’t understand the profound truth of his words. The conspiracy of the religious leaders would help bring about the redemption of mankind.

Jesus saves us from sin’s vicious grip. Have you received the freedom He offers?

By Remi Oyedele

Reflect & Pray


What road are you going down that could take you further away from God? He offers real freedom. What do you need to confess to Him today?


Give sin room, and it can take over a life.

I spent 4 years moving back and fourth between Anchorage, and my home town in Virginia, and worked various different jobs. I never went completely homeless, but I got close a couple of times, trusting people I should not have trusted. Business ventures that went bust. I ended up with nothing but my laptop, and the cloths on my back. But during that last time In Alaska, I met my wife, and We went back to my hometown, penny-less, but we had each other. I built a new life, got things moving with the VA, House, 2 cars, I am going to college full time, and I have a baby on the way. Things are looking up. Now the only thing left from the Army that is really a thorn in my side is all of my old injuries, and stuff. I have bad arthritis in my knees, hips, and elbows. I have a locked up SI joint (very painful), Multiple back injuries, including compressed vertebrae. So every day I wake up feeling like I was just hit by a Mack truck. So I can't do things I used to, running hurts like a bitch, and I try, but I just can't pull hard labor like I used too. So I am going to college to try a slightly different career path. Hopefully, when the VA finishes processing my claims, They will fairly compensate me for the hell I go through on a daily basis.

Also, when I've tried to do research, it seems most other people fear the actual act of eating. Not the case for me. It's when I finish, or nearly finish, that the dread starts creeping in. Even if I don't eat until I'm full, I still have this sensation like guilt as if I had just engaged in something gluttonous and gross. And I really just wanna puke it up and hide from everyone. Even though I'm perfectly in the mindset food is necessary for survival and my weight is average.

Because I'm pretty certain this isn't eating-disorder related, I think it could be tied to how I also fear getting obsessed with things. Like there's a couple books series I've read (4-5 years apart from eachother, mind) that I cannot finish to this day because midway through I realized how wrapped up I was in them.

I made this throwaway account yesterday to look for some help/advice in /r/mentalhealth. The post I made was very long and looking back on it seems like I'm just being too entitled and just need get over it. Every morning that I wake up I dread the day to come because I know that my main worries are if I have enough medication to make me not feel anxious or sick. I'm currently in an opiate recovery program and am prescribed a daily dose of suboxone and valium. I feel completely dependent on this medicine and going thru a day without it is incredibly difficult, mentally and physically. I will eventually be tapered off of all of the medications once we feel like I'm ready. But, with my current job and everything else that's going on with me I don't feel like I'm getting better. If anything, I think I've just dug myself into a deeper hole than when I started to reach out for help with my opiate addiction. Because I don't think I'll be able to afford &amp; support my 3 yr old daughter's upbringing I think, in the long run, my wife and daughter would be better off without me. Of course in the beginning it would be tough, but, once they got over it I think that someone else would be able to take care of them. I am coming up on 40 and at this point in my life I feel like I've squandered every opportunity I've been given and should be much more appreciative of everything that I have. My family loves me and wants me to do well obviously, but, at this point it just doesn't seem like I'll ever be that person who's able to afford not living without assistance. I am a financial burden to my mother and father and without my troubles I think they would be so much more content. I'm sorry for writing out another long post and I'm really not sure where I'm going with this, but when I woke up today I felt especially sad. I sat on my bathroom floor as quietly as I could while I was counting out my valium while looking at the calendar on my phone to see if I would have enough to take a little bit extra today so I wouldn't be so angry sitting working at my 9-5. The only thing that truly makes me happy is seeing my daughter be happy, I know what I said before is hypocritical to what I just said about her happiness. But, if I stay around I don't think I'll be able to give her the things that she deserves like a good school to go to, good food to eat everyday, a happy father who doesn't hide his feelings from his family and dr's.

One man’s story

Listening to Richard Adams describe the way he steps around ants to avoid crushing them, it’s hard to imagine that for many years he was an alcoholic who couldn’t keep a job, and had a habit of beating people that annoyed him – particularly employers. On his AboutFace video at http://www.ptsd.va.gov/apps/AboutFace/, Adams describes how his family begged him to get help, and says that while he was in psychiatric units on two occasions and also spent time in rehab, he always stopped treatment soon after leaving – something he now regrets. In 1994, he tried to commit suicide and eventually found the strength to stop drinking. But, his problems didn’t magically disappear when he stopped abusing alcohol. It would be almost another 11 years before Richard would seek help for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and finally get his life together.

Like so many people we hear about that suffer from PTSD, Richard is a veteran who served in Vietnam. When he returned home, he knew something was wrong but, “none of us talked about it,” he says. “We all tried to go on with our lives and some of my friends did good. Other friends of mine took their own lives . . . died of drug overdoses.”

Today, he encourages anyone who is having trouble coping, to seek help.

1508,"I'm a bad person I've been dealing with generalized anxiety disorder since I was 14 and dealt with my fair share of depression and loneliness. But, deep down I think I'm just a bad person. I'm mean, generally negative, inflexible in my beliefs and my actions, and arrogant. Worst of all, I'm a hypocrite and never learn from my mistakes. I hurt everyone around me and am generally just a lazy leech.

I tried therapy more than a few times in the past, but it doesn't help. I've had more than a few bad experiences with the whole thing, so I don't see myself giving it another try anytime soon, even if I could afford it. I react badly to anti-depressants and they don't seem to fix me anyway.

I've tried my absolute hardest to fix myself, but nothing seems to help. I've been going to the gym as often as I can. I lost 30 pounds. I stopped drinking entirely. I've been eating healthier and dress better. I've been trying to become a better cook. I've been listening to as many different types of music as I can and reading more. I've been trying to question everything I know and believe and be more aware of why I do things. I got a job working with the elderly, just to try to learn something and become a better human being.

But nothing seems to make a difference. I'm still just a shitty person. I'm going to college in about a month, so I'll finally stop being such a burden on my family, but I hate to think I'll subject more people to me. I just don't know what to do.",1.0,reddit mentalhealth
7708,"Not sure why I feel depressed, I have no reasons too. Any good audio books or podcasts to recommend? I feel like everyday its increasing harder and harder to stay positive.  Each day I go through the tasks of living without purpose struggling to get a sense of the point of it all.  I smile, pretend to be interested, pretend to care, etc...   I still do a good job at whatever I set out to do but seem to feel any sense of real purpose in the tasks and don't particularly get any joy from much.  These feelings started a few years back and used to only show up occasionally.  I could combat them internally usually within 24 hours or so through exercise or keeping busy etc...   However, more recently I tend to be struggling more often then not.

I don't know how best to describe my feelings exactly as clearly I feel depressed but I'm very self aware and feel its more then that and not that simple.  I recognize all the good I have in my life, I know that the way I feel is stupid, I continually try and wash it away with better thoughts, better habits etc.. but continually I just dislike the monotony that I seem to go through day in day out.

Seems simple enough to fix the monotony - do something different to mix it up.  Believe me I have.  I literally have a great job, I volunteer a ton, I get into and out of hobbies, etc...  but this lingering undertone of just finding a point to any of it seems to bit pick me.

I bring this up as more and more I find that I struggle to wear my happy mask(most think I'm always so happy)and I'm becoming increasingly negative, tired, easier to anger etc...  I also have times where I wonder why I'm even around at all.  Although I'm not suicidal I find at times I could careless if I live or not and its starting to scare me.

Over the years I've attempted lots of exercise, races, strength training and did well at all of them evening finishing in the top 10 of many races.  I still exercise at a lower level playing racquet sports, baseball, etc..  I've changed my diet to whole foods for a period of time, cut out caffeine, meditation, but nothing ever seems to stem the effects so eventually I just say f%^ it.

Can any one here relate?  Any new ideas on how to combat this?  Any good audio books, podcasts, or websites to recommend?  I would seriously love for these feelings to go away.",1.0,reddit depression

2886,"I keep messing up my anniversary Last summer was the worst months of anxiety. Last summer, I couldn’t stop anxiety and I kept checking and rechecking with my boyfriend. It was our 1st year anniversary and I was basically grilling him with questions for hours and he kinda just...snapped. Not angry, but his normally very patient self got very somber and just went: “I just wanted to have a nice anniversary”

Fast forward a year later, my anxiety is 10x better than what it was. I rarely get panic attacks, and when I do, they’re short.

Yesterday was our 2nd anniversary. BF want to have the day together to just chill. It’s an awesome, chill day, but we have to go to a rehearsal (I’m in a play, he’s doing lights). This irks him a bit because he really just wanted an “us” day (I did too), but the ppl there are fun so his annoyance doesn’t last long. We decide that after, we will go home to cuddle some more to finish off the day on an intimate note.

Anyway, my friend (who is also in the play) tells me her husband is away and is afraid of being by herself in the house. That gives HER anxiety (she also has BAD anxiety). She also can’t drive (due to anxiety as well). She asks me between scenes if she can sleep over at my house. I say sure because I know what panic feels like, and honestly, we are about to go on stage and I’m not even really thinking.

(A note: my bf and I live separately still; still living with parents to save money).

Fast forward to the end of rehearsal. I quickly tell my bf what’s going on (I honestly forgot I didn’t tell him; again it happened so quick). And I drop him off then take my friend to her place so she can get her stuff. We realize we can’t sleep over tonight (family stuff, long story) and so I drive back home. It’s too late at this point to go to his house (I’m exhausted) and again, I can’t sleep over with him tonight.

When I call my bf, he sounds not too happy. Just kinda short. I ask him what’s wrong, and he says he was looking forward to ending the day with just us, that it would have been different if I had talked to him about the change of plans first, but that it’s our anniversary and he feels abandoned. I at first get defensive, but then listen when he says he feels like his frustrations are sometimes fought against.

So that right there started getting me anxious, “I’m a bad partner, oh no oh no oh no”

So I listen to his frustrations, then I kinda just say, “I feel like there’s a trend of bad anniversaries, last year was bad and this year was too”

And he says “yeah last year was really bad. And this year...yeah it ended on a bad note”

My stomach dropped.

He is usually VERY understanding. Very sweet, always there when I am anxious. Always very patient, kind, supportive.

But apparently I just can’t stop fudging up anniversaries. I stayed up for three hours fighting against the urge to run or scream or break something or hurt myself (very characteristic of my panic).

I literally felt like my world was ending, just repeating in my head what a mess up I am.

I still feel anxious today. It was a struggle going to sleep :(

Idk what to do. I can’t go back and change it.

810,"Nightmarish anxiety after buying kitten and regretting it. How to cope with possible return of it? I had been missing having a cat for a few years and I was really 100% certain I was ready for the responsibility of getting a kitten. I did months of research and preparing before actually collecting the kitten. I only felt exitement about it at that time.

On the way home in the car after getting the kitten the shock hit me. I felt a terrible regret, and the actual reality of the situation suddenly was so obvious.

I'm now on day 5 after getting the kitten. The stress of the situation is really taking its toll on me. I am now 100% certain I am NOT ready for this responsibility and I feel horrible for feeling like this.

Every little cry from the kitten makes me feel extremely stressed and guilty. It cries and throws itself on my legs even if I do the dishes in the same room for ten minutes. I feel like I cant sit down for 5 minutes without it getting bored. Its not just this that is the problem though.

Ive made a horrible mistake and I feel so shameful. My biggest fear now is confronting the breeder with this. She is so passionate about the kittens and she has told me many times she is so sure that choosing me as this ones owner was the right choice and shes so happy about ut. I feel like a huge fraud. I feel so guilty for having to make her go through the process of rehoming the kitten again. I am terrified of her judging me. Im sure she'll think Im just some jerk who rushed into this without thinking and who doesnt care about the kitten.

How should I go about telling her to avoid as much judgement as possible?

8718,"found the instagram of my crush, too scared to message her Hey!

I have a crush on a girl from my university. She is in a different course, so we don't know each other. We've never talked, and until a few days ago I didn't even know her name. I always thought I'd never ask a girl out, but I like her so much that I convinced myself to do it. The problem is, I can't do it when there are people around her. I know, I shouldn't care but I know myself and I can honestly say I'm sure I will never talk to her until I see her alone. I've reached a point where I doubt I'll ever see her without friends around her. I've waited weeks for the opportunity to come but it just never came.

Every monday we have physics together and there's a list with all names of the students in the course. So I eventually found out her name and searched for her on instagram. I found her profile, but now I'm way too scared to message her. Not even because I'm afraid to be rejected, but because I think she will think ""what a creep, why does he know my name"". Sure I could be honest to her and tell her that I've tried to speak to her and that I believed this was my only chance to contact her, but I don't know... Of course, I could wait some more weeks, months, until the opportunity finally comes, but I really want to get this off my chest because all my thoughts are revolving around her and I'm losing so much sleep over this.

Does anybody have some advice on what to do? I appreciate it if you want to encourage me to do it when her friends are around her, but as I said, I'm 99% sure that I won't do it. You have to understand that talking to her at all would already be way out of my comfort zone.",1.0,reddit socialanxiety
7022,"I tried to call my branch manager for a hookup before I PCSd from Fort Sill. I had no such luck. He immediately put me on orders for Germany. He wouldn't even let me volunteer for DS or Recruiter. So I vowed that I wouldn't let Branch do that to me ever again. I've always been a firm believer that you can control your destiny. So I called branch about 15 months out from my DEROS from Germany. I asked what my options were, and I was told Alaska, Korea, Hawaii, and Fort Knox... none of which I was happy about. So I sat on it for a couple months and called back. Everything was the same, except for Knox which had dropped off. So after begging to go somewhere CONUS (because I'm coming from OCONUS) and getting denied, I grudgingly accepted Fort Wainwright and was told that my COT was being processed.

Fast forward 2 months, I still hadn't heard anything, and the pending assignment to AK had dropped off my ASK. I called my branch manager back, who had absolutely no knowledge of my COT! Then he asked me why I chose AK. Ummm... because I was only given OCONUS options and that was the best option for my family? His response was, and I quote, ""Why don't you go somewhere CONUS?"" BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME THERE WEREN'T ANY OPENINGS GUY! I don't condone assault, but he may have gotten hurt if he had been standing in front of me. He said that if I wanted to go CONUS, I just had to give him some choices and he would see what he could do. I immediately told him Fort Stewart. It was open. I chose it.

1903,"My Worst Fear is Becoming a Reality Pretty early this summer, I practically found out that my worst fear would be to live a life where I'm not making anyone happy. Just thinking about it, living a life where everyone is so indifferent to you and no one would recognize you, that gives me goosebumps. I do feel lonely at times, but to be so lonely that the world will never be moved by anything I do, that alone makes me shit my pants.

&amp;#x200B;

So this summer, losing a lot of my friends really makes me scared of what's coming up in the future for me. I kept just one friend from high school and we recently had a falling out. I also had a couple of online friends but recently, they've just been falling away from me too. Lastly, I had a love interest that I've been talking to for 5 years now. Although we were just online friends, it was basically known between us that we would be together if only we lived closer. We also fell out together and all this happened in just a two month span. I'm scared that I've basically maximized what I person I could become.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I can't grasp why all those people in my mind are just so turned away from me. Even my online friends and the people I barely knew when I went to school, I honestly loved. I can't tell you how much I love hearing about what people go through, what they love, what they want to be, what they love or hate. Just the fact that everyone human goes home and will experience something completely different is what makes the world so beautiful to me. Even though I didn't talk to much people, I loved listening to what people had to say about their day or week. With my online friends especially, I would do things like gift them with things. I remember writing an essay for one and they got a B and were really happy since it was a boring topic. For one online friend, I gave them a playlist and I found out all their favorite songs because they told me they weren't going to get gifts from anyone else. Even for that love interest, for her birthday last year, I went back to all of our conversations from all the social media we had together and I took my favorite messages she sent me and put it in a Google Doc with a custom link so she could read them all and think about the time we had together. In the end, she seemed really manipulative to me but she was the one to cut ties. This one especially hurt me. I was telling her about how I wasn't able to talk to her for a while since I had to go through things and right when I started talking about how she was hurting me, she told me to never talk to her again. And then right after that I got into an argument with my best friend from high school and it was the same story. It was the exact second I tried talking about how they were hurting me, they told me to never talk to them again. And right after that I started losing just so many others, right around the first half of summer.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel my problem is out of frustration. This is the first time I've ever truly felt lonely. I feel as if I can't make people as happy as other people can, no matter how much effort I put in. It's just as heartbreaking as having a crush on a girl or a boy and just never feeling like you're gonna be enough for them. I know this is gonna sound /r/niceguys of me to say, but I wish I had the opportunity to make someone a happy person. It's kind of a big meme to be like ""hehe why can't these girls give ME a chance"", but shit. I wish I would have the chance to make someone just the happiest person alive and I don't even think I'm alone on thinking like this. I guess people feel the most lonely when they aren't able to make people as happy as they could, even when they have friends.",1.0,reddit lonely

Billy the Kid is shot to death

Sheriff Pat Garrett shoots Henry McCarty, popularly known as Billy the Kid, to death at the Maxwell Ranch in New Mexico. Garrett, who had been tracking the Kid for three months after the gunslinger had escaped from prison only days before his scheduled execution, got a tip that Billy was holed up with friends. While Billy was gone, Garrett waited in the dark in his bedroom. When Billy entered, Garrett shot him to death.

Back on April 1, 1878, Billy the Kid ambushed Sheriff William Brady andone deputy in Lincoln, New Mexico, after ranch owner John Tunstall had been murdered. Billy had worked at Tunstall’s ranch and was outraged by his employer’s slaying-vowing to hunt down every man responsible. Sheriff Brady and his men, who had been affiliated with rival ranchers, were involved with the gang that killed Tunstall on February 18. Billy’s retaliatory attack left Brady and Deputy George Hindman dead. Although only 18 years old at the time, Billy had now committed as many as 17 murders.

Following his indictment for the murder of Sheriff Brady, Billy the Kid was the most wanted man in the West. Evading posses sent to capture him, he eventually struck a deal with the new governor of New Mexico: In return for his testimony against the perpetrators of the ongoing ranch wars in the state, Billy would be set free. Although he kept his word about the testimony, he began to distrust the promise that he would be released and so he escaped.

Once a fugitive, Billy killed a few more men, including the gunslinger Joe Grant, who had challenged him to a showdown. Legend has it that Billy managed to get a hold of Grant’s gun prior to the fight and made sure that an empty chamber was up first in the man’s revolver. When it came time to fire, only Billy’s gun went off and Grant was left dead.

Legendary Sheriff Pat Garrett finally brought Billy the Kid in to stand trial. The judge sentenced Billy the Kid to hang until “you are dead, dead, dead.” Billy reportedly responded, “And you can go to hell, hell, hell.” Two weeks before his scheduled execution, Billy escaped, killing two guards in the process.

Garrett mounted yet another posse to bring in the Kid. After tracing him to the Maxwell Ranch, Garrett shot him to death. No legal charges were brought against him since the killing was ruled a justifiable homicide.

When I was in middle school I had knew so many people and thought of some as friends. One day I started getting these suicidal thoughts and couldn't understand them (later finding out my parents kinda caused it). I remembered asking each and everyone about it... I was kinda shocked by the responses. ""You're selfish"", ""You could've been in a worst situation(as in actually ending it)"", ""People have it rougher than you."", ""Are you serious? Stop asking for attention."", ""You just cry too much."". What are all these responses, why are these so similar? Is it really me? Growing up I became depressed and isolated everyone I learned more on how I felt and thought was not wrong..  I just wish I had support. I never thought of a reason to dislike me either, but still..  is it me?
 This haunts me even now.

Present:
5-6 yrs went by. I am starting college and wanted that ""fresh start"", I knew no one and no one really knew me. I told myself to distance myself, however I couldn't help it I wanted friends... Join a few clubs (gaming and another culture). I never felt like I belong... I don't know how to act. I try to socialize but it didn't seem to work. End up being in some love triangle... met a guy I thought was the one. Met his friends, join his club, he was like my best friend. Broke up with me unexpectedly to  someone who he just met not too long ago and recently got out of a relationship with. She wasn't even interested in him as she said since we were ""friends"". She didn't really feel like a friend, but she was a good person. Suddenly it hurts being around those I feel were my friends... he acted like a jerk and started going after my single ""friends"" who recently got out of a relationship. They all don't like him that way, probably because they all know about me and care about me.
I feel like all these people are just nice and good people who do not want to hurt me even more... but they never felt like friends. Never ask how am I, never included me to group parties, never anything...
Even join this car crew( mabey ask because they knew me and need a girl with a nice car). It was nice and fun hanging with them all. But even at times I never felt included only just feeling like a shadow.
Tonight :
I try to believe I have friends....
In this culture club we have these ""families"" like a sorority and sisters, only smaller. They all have this party... a girl's night out... heh thanks for the invite. No one invited me, like the art painting party (when they even know I love art)...
I think about that sound (drifted away by rebecca sugar) and how much I can relate.

I just want a friend... someone I can have fun with and vice versa...
Everyone says I'm nice and stuff... but no one ever want me to hang out.
I try to invite them but they are always busy.
It's hard to even think... seeing it all on social media is now painful. I just want to delete it all and disappear from this world. I really don't think anyone will miss me only see a tragic thing.
I just wonder... is something wrong with me?...",1.0,reddit lonely
2861,"Mental Health and Addiction Issues Need Help/ Advice Hello,
I am someone who is suffering from undiagnosed and untreated mental health issue/issues. I self medicate with Alcohol, Marijuana, Nicotine, and a pretty absurd amount of Coffee to keep me going through a normal day. I need help/advice

The Story ---

I left the trucking industry after I had realized that it was not something that I wanted to do in life. At that time I was 21. *In a single year I had become a mentor on one of the top trucking routes in the company. -From there I went to live with a girlfriend's family for a couple years while trying to find my footing in the local trucking market, which I successfully did, while still finding myself wanting more out of my career. (In this period, I started smoking marijuana and drinking to larger and larger degrees.) I decided to quit my job and make a complete career jump by enrolling in college in search of a better work-life/life in general. I was accepted at a small University in Arizona. I chose the major of Community Development/Sustainability due to an increased interest in becoming involved in the public domain. Thus began a long, long three years. I managed to graduate with my Bachelors in those three years with a solid GPA. During my college experience, I found myself incredibly isolated. I was, in essence, the weird guy at school. People didn't want to talk to me, and I can't blame them. I was a completely functioning and successful addict, albeit manic and depressed. So I spent literally ALL of my time alone. In that period I relied more and more on anything that could keep me mellow so that I could sit down and produce whatever I knew was expected of me. *minus successful social interactions, and believe me I tried. I graduated last May, so it has been a year. Since then I ended up getting a job that I was, again, unhappy with. I got a promotion and decided it was dead end so I quit, broke my apartment lease (*paid it off), and am now living in a wood cabin in the hills of West Virginia with my Step-Dad. I am 27 years old.

I have found that in the last four years I have become increasingly unable to communicate effectively with other individuals on a friendly/social level. I just can't connect. This has translated into me pretty much destroying all the relationships I had with family (no one blood related will talk to me anymore) and friends (I don't have any). I can't get through an interview process for a decent job because I definitely give off weird vibes and can honestly see the disconnect that they do. I just don't know how to fix it. I've tried numerous times to get psychiatric services with minimal success do to financial issues. I have been admitted to in-treatment at the emergency room twice now for suicide attempts and found there services to be abhorrent and completely unhelpful, in addition to incredibly expensive. In neither circumstance was I ever able to talk with a psychiatrist and pretty much just lied in order to get out of there. 

The Problem---

I'm not sure anymore what direction is up or down. I don''t know whats wrong with me (depression, bipolar, borderline, etc.). I'm not sure if my substance issues are causing my mental degradation or just a symptom of it, and I don't know where to turn. I don't have money, and the services so widely promoted online and otherwise are so much harder to access than how we promote it. People say just reach out, and I have, only to find that no one knows what to do or how to help. I'm currently not smoking marijuana, drinking, and have cut coffee out of the picture. This hasn't helped at all. I'm in debt, have an incredibly small earning potential, a lack of social skills, and the inability to find the services I might need to reverse all of this. I want something to allow me to be ""normal"" and function like those I aspire to be. I recently tried getting an appointment at a reputable hospital's NeuroPsychiatric Department only to find the waiting list to be around 4-6 months. I feel alone, depressed, and helpless. More so, I feel scared that my only way out of this is through suicide, which I have done a fair amount of research on and am confident in my ability to ensure it's success this time.

-Sorry for the depressing/depressingly long post or for any irrationality that is conveyed in me just trying to translate my thoughts into text.-

840,"I work as a preloader for UPS. One of my drivers yelled at today for how i loaded his truck. I have been working here for 3 weeks loading 3 trucks everyday and while I can handle the first two, the third truck always has awkward packages and package volume; it is very difficult to make it neat. There is a chart and a preload assist label that tells you exactly where each package goes on which shelf. But for this truck, there were special cases for packages with a certain postal code and i feel like I get it wrong each time. He doesn't explain it enough(or maybe I'm just stupid) and I try my best to organize it but it feels like he's getting sick of me.
He told me ""you're making me go crazy"" today when I took a location that had like 5+ packages for it and moved it to an adjacent, empty shelf so that it wouldn't cram up. I guess he didn't like that. I'm just so afraid of asking him again for clarification so I just load it better next time and hope he doesn't yell at me again when he shows up.

I'm really thinking about quitting. I already struggle with self esteem issues and I don't ever want to be the reason someone gets pissed off. It's just one of those feelsbad days.

7467,"Need advice in helping someone with alcoholism while I have his attention! My brother, who suffers from severe alcoholism, has finally taken the first step to seeking help. He called me last night, while intoxicated, and I told him I would help him. He currently drinks daily from the moment he wakes up, reportedly, several shots in the morning, mid day, and night. And light drinking here and there throughout the day. The problem is he just quit his job yesterday, has no health insurance, and I am in very tough place financially. Bipolar runs in our family, and I suspect he may have bipolar type 2, who’s depressive episodes may have been the reason for seeking refuge in alcohol. I have bipolar and was able to get help from a GREAT psychologist-psychiatrist who charges $250 per session. She diagnosed me on the first day and put me on the best medications for me when many failed to do. I am going to help him, but I’m curious as to what should be my plan of action. What step should I take first considering money is so limited? I told him last night I would schedule an appointment with my favorite psychologist, it was what first came to mind. He said he may not remember tomorrow about having called me, so I told him I would send him a text that night so he sees it in the morning. He is also having some thoughts of suicide. Thoughts of suicide happened once before when he was fired from his previous job—he took some pills, although it was not serious.

I have repeatedly sprained my ankle. I have lost count how many times, at least 50 within a 2 year time period. I was a professional dancer, until I quit because I couldn't take the sprains. I could be walking normally on a flat surface,  and it would just give out from under me.  I was constantly on edge. I still get flashes between steps of my ankle spraining. Each step is a chance for it to give out. I think about it and my heart rate to just spikes through the roof.

7822," |body| Vietnam Veterans Memorial dedicated

Near the end of a weeklong national salute to Americans who served in the Vietnam War, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is dedicated in Washington, D.C. after a march to its site by thousands of veterans of the conflict. The long-awaited memorial was a simple V-shaped black-granite wall inscribed with the names of the 57,939 Americans who died in the conflict, arranged in order of death, not rank, as was common in other memorials.

The designer of the memorial was Maya Lin, a Yale University architecture student who entered a nationwide competition to create a design for the monument. Lin, born in Ohio in 1959, was the daughter of Chinese immigrants. Many veterans’ groups were opposed to Lin’s winning design, which lacked a standard memorial’s heroic statues and stirring words. However, a remarkable shift in public opinion occurred in the months after the memorial’s dedication. Veterans and families of the dead walked the black reflective wall, seeking the names of their loved ones killed in the conflict. Once the name was located, visitors often made an etching or left a private offering, from notes and flowers to dog tags and cans of beer.

The Vietnam Veterans Memorial soon became one of the most visited memorials in the nation’s capital. A Smithsonian Institution director called it “a community of feelings, almost a sacred precinct,” and a veteran declared that “it’s the parade we never got.” “The Wall” drew together both those who fought and those who marched against the war and served to promote national healing a decade after the divisive conflict’s end.

5268,"major depressive disorder is different than someone who sees a counselor because they are depressed.

My whole point is that gender dysphoria is looked at like someone who is depressed, not someone who has major depressive disorder.

The mental health terms we use are wrong in so many cases. What psychologist and psychiatrist have found is that gender dysphoria is more a symptom that can be treated and it can also resolve. Treatment can be difficult or it can be somewhat easy. Every person is unique in their transition and not everyone is suicidal or wanting surgery.

The only “treatment” I do at this point is hormones. If I miss those hormones, it isn’t life threatening or debilitating. I would say my gender dysphoria is resolved and so did my counselor.

ADHD is a lifelong thing people will deal with. It can be treated with meds but it is something that needs constant medicinal intervention much like major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.

It's hard for warriors to even admit they have a problem but when they do, they have the hard part behind them. It's important for Vets to know if they have a problem, they need to know there is help waiting for them. Just check out the local VA or contact the suicide  hot line. I know for a fact, when I  separated, I didn't get any kind of information about anything, except the insurance. Times have changed for the better I must say, all you have to do is ask (the hardest part) and be put in touch with a specialist .

2905,"The only way I think I can cope with it, and I know it's not a good idea I was sexually assaulted nine years ago during college. I lost a lot of friends, became socialphobic after that, made new friends who weren't good people, had constant suicidal thoughts, called suicide hotline and it made me feel worse, missed my classes and exams and ended up dropping out of college.

The guy came into my life when I was feeling the most vulnerable. My family was going through financial crisis and I didn't even have the money to fly back and spend time with them during the holiday break. He said he wants to hang out with me and be my company.

I know where he works and I always fantasize about going to his work place and humiliating him in front of everyone. For three years I sent him angry, vengeful, random messages nearly every day. I stopped doing that after realizing how insane I might have seemed.

Time helped me heal but every once in a while when I'm doimg something, all of a sudden I get flashbacks and I get so resentful. I wish him all the misfortune in life because he pretended to be so kind despite knowing what I was going through, and took advantage of me. I keep getting this temptation to send texts but I know it's not a good idea. I just wish he realizes what a disgusting POS he is and I can only hope he isn't doing this to anyone.

6736,"Confused and Anxious I'm a 15 year old male and I've been struggling with a low self image and depression for a while now. It started halfway through middle school, when I suddenly became very self conscious and thought that everyone hated me, so I wouldn't talk to anyone and I never made any friends. Fast forward to Freshman year, and I don't talk to anyone at school - I just do my work, go home, waste time, go to bed, and do the same thing again the next day.

Now that it's summer, it's gotten even worse. I have a few friends that live in the same city as me (but we all go to different schools) that I play video games with, but playing the same games every day is boring and I honestly feel mostly empty when I do.

I have a few hobbies, I like playing tabletop games and I like writing (which is the only thing I can say I'm confident with myself in) but I can't help but just feel empty. Every day is a rinse and repeat, with me just sitting around, just playing games or watching YouTube videos. I don't go outside too often, and I don't have the motivation to. I often feel worse than others because I don't have as many friends or I don't do as much with my life.

So, tl;dr, I'm a 15 year old socially reclusive shut-in who doesn't have many friends and goes through the same routine every day.

771,"My faith has always been important to me,  but with two weeks left in my first AFG deployment I realized that I had been taking my faith (along with many other things) for granted.  During a 10 hour firefight in temperatures over 120 degrees Fahrenheit, I became pinned down on a ridgeline while trying to provide medical aid to a teammate.  After stabilizing the teammate, the Afghan Commandoes and I had to hold the support by fire position for a few hours while we waited for our helicopters.  We barely had a foot of cover to hide behind and every time we exposed ourselves we were greeted with a hail of gunfire.  While I lay in the prone position for hours I started to think I was on my death-bed.  I began asking myself questions about my life: Was I the man I wanted to be? Did I live my life with zeal? Was I a good husband, brother and friend?  Did I practice my faith the way I should have?  I did not like the answers I gave back to these questions and realized I had taken so many things in life for granted.  Ultimately I wondered if I would go to Heaven or Hell.  By the grace of God I broke contact off the ridgeline but I learned a valuable lesson to never take anything in life granted because there might not be another opportunity.  I applied this lesson to all aspects of my life, especially my faith.  When I was shot I once again thought I was going to die, but it was much different than the first time because I had been living life to the fullest in all aspects, in essence I was ready to die.

During my recovery, my faith has been instrumental.  There were times I was mad at God and asked Him why he allowed me to survive only to suffer so much pain and anguish.  However, I always knew that events in life happen for a reason and I was enduring this for a purpose.  Over time I have come to realize that I underwent these brutal experiences to learn from them.  I was taught the virtues of humility and empathy through experiencing the pangs of addiction, the helplessness of having to rely on others, the numbness of posttraumatic stress and the despair of living with chronic pain.  Now that I have made it through this crucible, it is my responsibility to tell my story and pass on the lessons I learned.

1)Breathe slowly. Breathe in for a count of 4, breathe out for a count of 6 or 7 repeat.

2) Find a phrase that helps you, something short. He said his favorite is ""Lord have mercy"" or mine, I am a Christian and I connect with this one, ""I am with you always."" Repeat the phrase to yourself over and over while breathing slowly.

3) You can take it one step further (I didn't do this, this morning) and try to remember a memory where you felt fully and completely at peace, no anxiety, and take yourself there remember how it felt. While remembering that anxiety free moment touch a place on your body, like your wrist so that eventually all of this will make it so when you touch your wrist you go back to the calm place. Don't touch your wrist if you feel the anxiety creeping back in, only touch your wrist when you are at that place of peace. Repeat.

All three of these take time to condition yourself but it works!! I try to do 1 and 2 every day, I usually do it for 15 minutes without realizing, the time flys and I feel so calm right now. I have been. Calm for 30 minutes, I don't know how long it will last but FINALLY something works!!!

7691,"I [34M] got touched inappropriately when I was a kid by another kid at school. Never talked about it, but think I want to now. This happened when I was in first or second grade (this is in the US). At my elementary school, when recess was over, a bell would ring and all the kids were supposed to form a line in front of the door to their classroom and wait for the teacher to open the door.

So that's what had happened. I was standing in the back of the line for my class, when another boy came up behind me and kind of wrapped his arms around me. Then he shoved his hands in my pockets, kind of fondled my genitals through my clothes, and whispered things into my ear that I can't really remember. The one thing I remember him saying was like ""let's do sex"" or like something similar.

Anyway, I never told anyone about this. I've never even really acknowledged to myself that this happened. I've just always pretended it didn't happen. Looking back on it now it seems very likely that that kid was himself being molested or something horrible like that, and it only happened this one time.

I'm really not sure how to go about talking about this with my girlfriend. She herself has her own trauma with sexual assault that I don't want to trigger or somehow cause her to relive.

I have always been a private person but these days, I actually panic when someone asks my anything even distantly related to my past; it's all too complicated to explain and I feel afraid of being judged or seen as different (although my family and close friends have always been supportive and never ever made me feel that way). Nowadays, I tend to be extremely evasive and am overcome with anxiety whenever someone asks me anything that could somehow trace back to that failure or unpleasant experience. I mutter the bare minimum truth and swiftly (and almost thoughtlessly) change the topic. I've stopped correcting false assumptions if that means I won't have to explain or relive those past experiences and worries. However, what is really scaring me is that, while in a state of panic, I've begun to blurt out small lies about my past just to avoid explaining my everything (only done this a few times and with two people). I'm extremely scared and ashamed. I was never ever like this, and I hate myself for behaving in this way!

I  don't think that my past experiences or the things I've said will affect anyone else in any way, shape or form, and most of my interactions and feelings are genuine and truthful; in fact, whenever someone has asked me a direct question, I've given a direct and truthful answer -- even if it was extremely uncomfortable for me. I've also been very open about some personal very feelings (which have nothing to do with those past experiences). I feel so guilty and ashamed, not only because I've been evasive and deceptive, but also because in trying to cover up a few unpleasant experiences, I've negated all the good experiences I've had.

494,"""Man convicted in slaying of Nellis airman"" |body| From: Las Vegas Review Journal

A Las Vegas man was convicted Friday in the slaying of Nellis airman Nathan Paet.

A Clark County jury of six men and six women took a little more than an hour to find Michael Rodriguez guilty of three charges: first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and burglary while in possession of a deadly weapon.

The same jury is expected to decide next week whether Rodriguez, 36, should be sentenced to death.

Paet, an Air Force staff sergeant, was gunned down in the garage of his southwest valley home as he left for work on the night of Dec. 1, 2010. Prosecutors said his wife, Michelle Paet, had a fleeting affair with Rodriguez and the two devised a plan to have Nathan Paet killed so they could collect $600,000 from his life insurance.

Nathan Paet was the assistant non-commissioned officer-in-charge for the Strike Aircraft Maintenance Supply section of the 757th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron at Nellis Air Force Base.

He was born in 1982 in Tamuning, Guam. He and Michelle were high school sweethearts. After graduation, Nathan joined the Air Force in April 2002, and the two married in 2006.

Family members who attended the trial said he worked a graveyard shift to provide for his family and regularly drove his four children, who were ages 2 through 9, to and from school.

His mother, Carmenita Paet, called him ""an island boy"" who enjoyed all types of outdoor activities, ""from the ocean to the snow.""

He was good to his children and taught them to respect their elders, she said.

Nathan Paet also was unaware of his wife's infidelity and never spoke of any suspicions with his relatives, they said.

The first of five shots struck Nathan Paet in the neck as he put on his shoes in the garage, prosecutors said. As gunfire continued, he stumbled back inside the home, blood soaking his camouflage fatigues, and collapsed in front of his children while Michelle Paet was inside the home.

Prosecutors said Rodriguez and Michelle Paet planned the murder over the course of six months, while Rodriguez thoroughly studied Nathan Paet's life insurance policy. They determined Rodriguez would get $150,000 for orchestrating the slaying.

Rodriguez, who admitted to being at the scene of the crime, is the first of four defendants, along with Michelle Paet, alleged gunman Corry Hawkins and alleged accomplice Jessica Austin, to face trial in the killing.

This is a difficult question to answer.  Why?  My grandfather and father were both vets.  They were strong men who left a mostly positive influence on me as a boy.  I played with GI Joes and little green Army men.  We played hide and seek and had neighborhood wars with snowballs, walnuts, apples, rocks, and BB guns.  My parents let me get it out.  I'm a vet.  After my first hitch on active duty, I was interesting in going to college and starting a family.  However, I enjoyed much of what I was doing and continued in the reserves for another 9 years.  I traveled, met many different people, learned to have respect and take care of myself, in both urban and wilderness environments.  I loved that.  I learned to work hard.  I had a full time job and went to college full time while I was in the reserves.  I know something about being committed enough to give up everything for the mission and the disappointments and anguish we sometimes experience after returning.  As an older vet now, I understand pride of service, and that being a veteran doesn't guarantee anyone anything.  It was an honor and I'm thankful that I survived.  That alone should be enough.  I like helping others, it's part of being a Christian.  Military morals align with my Christian morals.  I will still defend everyone and everything around me, including other veterans, up to and including my life.  I often watch over veterans when they do not know I'm there or who I am.  I like working and networking with other veterans.  Sure we are passionate and sometimes conflicting but we will accomplish the mission, no matter what.  That attitude is very helpful in the civilian world sometimes.  I will not drive by a veteran hitchhiking or walk by a homeless veteran without reaching in my pocket.  It is not who I am.  Someday, I might be the father of another veteran.  It would be a great honor to pass that legacy on to another generation.  I am nothing unique.  I am a soldier for life in all facets.  I'll put my boots on right now and run with you.  I am not the greatest soldier.  I don't know why I am this way and have often wondered.  It is not an easy lifestyle.

2914,"5 APR--This Day in US Military History |body| 1986 – A Berlin nightclub was bombed and 2 US soldiers and a woman were killed and 230 injured.

La Belle discothèque was was commonly frequented by United States soldiers, and two of the dead and 79 of the injured were American servicemen.
A bomb placed under a table near the disk jockey's booth exploded at 1:45 am CET killing instantly Nermin Hannay, a Turkish woman, and U.S. sergeant Kenneth T. Ford. A second American sergeant, James E. Goins, died from his injuries two months later. Some of the victims were left permanently disabled.
Libya was held responsible for the bombing by the US government, and US President Ronald Reagan ordered retaliatory strikes on Tripoli and Benghazi in Libya ten days later. The strikes reportedly killed at least 15 people, including Colonel Qaddafi's adopted daughter.
Palestinian Yasser Shraydi (Chraidi) was suspected of playing a lead role in the bombing of the La Belle discotheque. In 1996 he was extradited from Lebanon to face charges in Germany. In 1996 Andrea Hasler was arrested in Greece and extradited to Germany. Also a woman named Verena Chanaa, suspected of planting the bomb, and her former husband named Ali Chanaa were arrested in Berlin. In 1997 Musbah Abulghasen Eter was arrested by Italian police in Rome in connection with the bombing. In 2001 V. Chanaa was sentenced to 14 years, A. Chanaa and Eter were sentenced to 12 years, and Chraidi was sentenced to 14 years. Libya was implicated and in 2004 agreed to pay $35 million in compensation.

2432,"part of me gets what you are saying and I think your stance is logical. The other part of me lived just that experience when I was younger so I see the value in education.

I literally felt like I was the only person on the entire planet that experienced gender dysphoria until I was 13. That’s age 5 until 13 I felt trapped. I couldn’t approach my parents about it because they made fun of people like that. I literally was alone.

Now, do most 10 year olds know if they are gay? Probably not. Most still think the opposite sex have “cooties” and all that. That is where perhaps my experience being trans is a bit different than a more general “LGBT lesson.”  I will say though, most trans people I know started feeling this way right around kindergarten age. I’ve read stories of young trans kids committing suicide because they felt completely trapped and alone and the only reason people found out was because of a letter they left behind.

Now, this isn’t to say forcing students to participate in an lgbt project is necessarily right when “celebrating” pride month. For me, I’m all for kids as young as third and forth grade getting sex education because the truth is, kids are having sex. We can look at the reasoning behind it and cast a ton of blame at the reasoning but it doesn’t stop the now.  It, sexual preference and my experience is also different. I don’t consider myself gay or lesbian.

I can’t imagine how different my life would have been if I would have figured out I wasn’t alone when I was younger.

So, am I for a class doing LGBT projects? Not really. That kind of comes across as a middle finger to those who don’t like it. Do I think resources need to be available and education done on the topic? You bet.

In the end, I’m all for providing help to those like me but I’m afraid the efforts of the far left with their “mandatory pride celebration” and “drag-queen story hours” will dominate over the real need which is helping kids learn who they are.

I've PTSD for a long time (caused by the death of two boyfriends, two children, cancer twice, childhood sexual abuse, physically and mentally abusive marriage - the list is just ridiculous). I had it under control, then I was involved in a car accident. I was stopped for backed up traffic, the person behind me hit me at 75 mph, spun me across the interstate and rolled down the embankment. Woke up hanging from my seatbelt and my friend paralyzed (temporarily, but didn't know that then). It stirred up things I had settled. Went to therapy, got everything settled (again).

Fast forward to a year ago - I get with this great guy. Things are going very well and I'm finally happy. I start having paid from the cart accident again and I go to the doctor for a few more months. I find out I have a permanent injury they can't fix, amd the pain is persistent. This affects my 12 year career, changes so much for me, and I have trouble leaving it behind like I could work everything else because it's THERE every damn day.

Enter more PTSD: angry, irritable, need quiet time to calm down but I never get any, feel overwhelmed all day every day, and I never get a break from it. Wonderful boyfriend isn't so wonderful anymore. He's one of those people who have had a mostly charmed life and never had to deal with anything especially hard besides the regular punches of life. I need his support, I need him to curb the triggers that he's able to. I need extra help while I get my shit straight again. But, he doesn't do what I tell him I need, then gets angry with me when I'm not able to keep things together (housework, cooking, laundry, my demeanor). I've told him how paralyzing it can be. I don't know if I haven't explained it the right way, or if he just doesn't care. I'm back in therapy, but every time I get a smidge better he's to the point he wants  to break up with me and causes a setback.

Those of us who are disabled and authorized to seek treatment through the VA are exposed to this issues every time we contact the VA.
IMHO the vast majority of veterans are most likely not authorized for VA care since their service-connected disability is 20% or lower. Those veterans are the ones who may be able to benefit from suicidal counselling and treatment to prevent suicide.

It's very hard to explain the things that I've been going through for, I believe is a few years, but I'll try.
There are many times when I'm convinced someone is watching me. I know it's a generic story, but when I think about it, I'm paranoid to no end.
And it's been happening for so long that I've convinced myself everything weird that happens is just their fault and it's normal.
There's sounds I'd hear, for an example, like just today it was buzzing noises, almost like a phone buzz. These noises were coming from my bedside table, which is completely empty. This is just one example of many, and I'm well aware I maybe thinking to too much into this.
I turned off the video I was watching so I could hear the buzzing better and the buzzing just stopped. So I turned my video back on. Then the buzzing happend again, video off, no buzzing. The noise wasn't coming from my phone or the video I can promise that. I turned off my phone and listened for a good five minutes and then shrugged it off. I'd tell myself it was the person (who's watching me) doing it and it was normal. Or that it was part of my imagination. Which I'd believe if stuff like that didn't happen all the time.

Idk. I believe it's more than one person. I know I sound nuts or like I'm making this up, but it really is killing me. I'm aware of what other people think like and that this is not normal.

Two weeks later, I didn't need a crutch. 1 month later, I had no pain.

I continued on, for a year, showing up three times per day, until I felt as if I was on top of the world.

I went to an ashram, and I learned how to teach yoga. When I got back, I started teaching, for free, to elderly people, and also to the 26 people that lived (and still do live) in a residential place for the 'mentally not-quite all there'' people.

For about ten years, I have been doing this, and I feel fine! And the elderly people and the those in the home, they are al feeling so much better.

That might not be much to anyone that runs a charity or is on a hotline for suicidal people, but it IS my way of helping out some people that were normally consigned to not seeing family because they are old or 'crazy', being basically left to die. They now have better lives, because I cared enough to do this.

Anyone can help the elderly, and/or the people that are shunted aside by society. All it takes is a bit of compassion. I do wish that I could do more for more of society, but hey. I am ONE man. Imagine if every family could take an hour a week to help, how much the USA would be a better place?

I am not a hero. Just one guy in the right place at the right time. Going out at Thanksgiving and Christmastime might be a nice thing to do, but these people do need help, day in and day out.

Not entirely, I get that. I dont drink, I work in a service industry, I am superficially a good member of society. So my lil ted talk would be “I was expected to be dead or a selfabsorbed addict or fully mental and im not”.

Instead I am a partially functioning human who cannot sustain a relationship nor run a house. I live alone with multiple reminders to shower and do housework. I have 3-6 year relationships which end because I am “too much”.

I have no career but work parttime in an entry level nursing because Im good at it but also live paycheck to paycheck. And Im grateful for my work.

I texted my partner to please come upstairs because I needed comforting/grounding. I lay there for 15 minutes panicking and nothing, no response, so I eventually forced myself up and went down to the middle level of our home. I started tidying but needed a break because I still wasn’t with it entirely.

He eventually emerges from the basement and was like I just got your text. I asked for a hug and I wrap my arms around him tight focusing on where I was what I could see feel etc. He didn’t hug back and immediately I felt him being uncomfortable with hugging (he’s not a very touchy person) so I let go and sat down. Despite me being in distress he starts talking about leaving to go for a drive. I’m listening and responding to him. I clear off a seat next to me and he huffs and says “or not” as he grudgingly sits next to me. I cling to his arm and receive nothing back, I’m shaking.

I feel so awkward. I needed just the smallest bit of reassurance. I had explained what happened and still nothing. I give up and curl up in the corner of the sectional with the dog and just make myself small into a tight comforting space with the dog laying in front of me.

So I've recently started to come to terms with the idea of having PTSD.
I've been having a hard time the last few years financially and mental health wise. Things just sort of exploded my second semester of my first year of uni. So I'm finally seeing a psychiatrist and getting help to get to a mental space that is healthy enough to deal with the trauma. However, I'm having a ""It gets worse before it gets better"" reaction to addressing and identifying my trauma. I guess because my trauma is based around my experiences of emotional, physical, and psycho-sexual abuse from my father and an incident of rape a couple of years ago, it's being triggered around men and my boyfriend in particular.

My boyfriend has been wonderful and patient and does his best when it comes to my depression and anxiety. But he has trouble remembering or knowing how to react when it comes to PTSD related things.

I guess I need advise on how to talk to my boyfriend about it and how to approach it. He wants to be supportive but I still don't know all the triggers or how to deal with my responses to them like I do my anxiety and depression so I'm having trouble letting him in or guiding him. ",1.0,reddit ptsd

Do you think it would be a good idea to hire the Doctors and PA's that were active military members to be the Doctors that work at the VA? Or at least have them as the head doctors at the Va and all major decisions on a veteran health issues would have to go through them for final say so.

They would be able to relate to us veterans more, because they would understand us more. I think it would also be a good job to hire the nurses that were veterans also and the medics.
One it might cut down on problems that we have when we go to the doctor for a check up or to the ER for a problem.

Me for one I know I have almost cussed out the nurses in the ER who didn't want to listen what I had to say and she though she knew more about my situation then I did. The best ER visit I had was when I went this week and my nurse was a veteran and he was training a new nurse coming on. The doctor was a good one also.

One problem they did have though, a veteran came it with chest pains and they helped him but when they tried to admit him they couldn't. There was no doctor on the floor for one and the doctor who was suppose to work the floor had gone home. They ended up sending him to the naval hospital and admitted him there. I've talked to other veterans here in Virginia and they have had similar problems with the hospital here. I know the hospital in Salisbury NC is a good hospital but you have to be dieing to get admitted. They only have 35 beds in the main hospital so that is a problem at some of the VA hospitals also. Would just like to get everyone's input on this and find a way to get our government look at the plus it would be to have veterans serving veterans.

For a U.S. Army where failures to treat soldiers with substance abuse problems have been linked to suicides, Georgia National Guard Spc. Stephen Akins was another tragedy waiting to happen.

Scans of his brain showed scars, and he had a history of seizures, combat blast exposure and suicide attempts. All were indisputable evidence that the soldier needed a medical retirement — despite erratic behavior that led to punishable infractions, his lawyer and psychiatrist argued. Such a move would offer a smooth transition from the Army to the care of the VA.

But the Army didn't see it that way. A two-star general with no medical background concluded that the 31-year-old soldier's behavior — drunken driving, speeding, missed appointments and urinalysis cheating — had nothing to do with traumatic brain injury or emotional problems and kicked him out of the Army.

On July 2, six months after he was expelled, Chrystal Akins found her son dead in the basement bedroom of her home in Austell, Ga., just west of Atlanta, victim of an apparent suicide by overdose, according to police. ""It totally blew me away,"" she said about prying open his bedroom door and finding his body on his bed. ""I'll live with this the rest of my life.""

As police investigating his death await a toxicology report to determine more precisely what killed him, Chrystal Akins says she struggles with how the Army handled her son.

""He wanted to go out there and do something for his country and this is what he gets in return,"" she said. ""I just don't understand why people are like that. They just wanted to get him out.""

Her son was buried with military honors on July 9 at the Georgia National Cemetery in Canton.

Long story short:

I was prescribed vyvanse in high-school (60mg) and rarely took it due to how awkward and pissed off it would make me at school. I took a pill on days I had tests, and often took 120mg on sundays ( 2 pills) to binge homework, but I rarely took above 3 pills in a week  I was a fairly decent student. I was in honors classes and got well above a 3.0 GPA and had a 29 ACT.

A few days before freshman year of college at a big university, I talked to my GP and he decided to switch me to adderall ir because I didn't take the stims everyday. I was prescribed 10mg adderall ir  x 2 a day.  I always liked the feeling of vyvanse, but hated how awkward it made me feel. I am an introvert by nature.  When in college I had more time to spend to myself, and I started to LOVE the feeling of the adderall ir. However, it took a long time for me to become ""addicted"".

&amp;#x200B;

I now feel like I need to say I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder type II and ADHD. I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2nd grade and bipolar before I ever took amphetamine, at around eighth grade. I have had symptoms of hypomania and depression since, but the adderall made them SO much worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I became truly addicted the next semester where I would fly through my scrip in around two weeks. I would have to buy more for the rest of the month from people in my fraternity. I spent a lot of money.

&amp;#x200B;

After the end of the semester I took around a 3 week break until i caved and got another scrip. I felt normal at the end of those 3 weeks but still not 100%.  I also had 20mg pills now instead of 10mg.

&amp;#x200B;

That summer I got a girlfriend, who I am still now dating today and knows about my addiction; as I have opened up to her fully.

&amp;#x200B;

That summer though, I hid it pretty damn well. I didn't take the addys some of the days I would hangout with her, which would be around four days a week. But, those other days I would take up to 80mg and play guitar all day.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember the few weeks before sophomore year I abused the fuck out of my prescription, playing guitar all day. When I went into the semester, my amphetamine tolerance was extremely high.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I became long distance but I didn't mind because I could not love anyone else more.  I have opened up to her completely and she's sitting next to me doing homework while I'm writing this post rn lol.

&amp;#x200B;

The beginning of my sophomore year I immediately started abusing adderall and I binged up to 60-200mg a day, same case, I would buy more when I ran out.  It was all I could think about.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I also started abusing xanax simultaneously. Although I was able to quit after a few weeks, (a few day relapses occured) of around 1mg a day, or half of a xanax bar.  I had a withdraw from xanax for a few days but it was never a HUGE issue, but the withdraws were HORRIBLE. I hate benzos now  because they fuck up my life 100x more than addys do. They fucked up my school work for those few weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

I came home after that semester and had withdraws like a mother fucker but was clean for 3 weeks, then I caved again. I only had a 20mgxr day a  scrip, but as you would guess, I abused it. When I ran out I went cold turkey, but I occasionally would buy some 30mg IR pills from a kid down the block, but he never had too many.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt less addicted the next 6-8 months and only had a few days a month where I would be completely strung out. I would feel bad after each relapse but I was happy that it was not ruining my life at the moment, because it was not. I would use it to play guitar all day. I improved a lot and I don't think of myself too highly, but apparently I got really fucking good.

&amp;#x200B;

I came to a new university with my girlfriend this fall and went 3 weeks with no addys. I wanted to quit but could not do it with how rigorous the courses I was taking were. I'm going to a very prestigious university now. Previously, my old one was mediocre or decent. I have NO IDEA how I even got into this school, I'm pretty lucky.

&amp;#x200B;

After 3 weeks, I got a prescription for 60mg of vyvanse a day + 20mg of addy IR a day, and I abused the fuck out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so shitty about this but I quickly abused the scrip even though my girlfriend held onto it, causing some conflict. The ""abuse"" didn't last long but I recognize I was prescribed amphetamines at unhealthy dosages.

&amp;#x200B;

I then got a prescription for 30mg IR adderall twice a day. I abused a lot but mostly took 60mg which is way too much IMO.

&amp;#x200B;

I took 60-100mg of adderall a day for the semester.  All I could think about was Adderall. Here I recognize that if this doesn't stop my life is fucked, I am so dependent on these pills to get anything done. My mind is fixed around the wave of euphoria and the high I get.

&amp;#x200B;

I just finished my last final a few hours ago and that was the last dose of amphetamine I plan to take.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to a rehab program over my xmas break so I know I don't relapse again. I am looking forward to talking to other addicts in similar and different situations.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering, after reading my story, how long will it take me to fell ""normal again"", and be able to focus to the same ability without addys. I am afraid it's going to take forever which will cause a relapse.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a part of this ""frat"" (we dont live together tho) that i'm beginning to suspect everyone just tolerates me at.

Every time I'm there, I'm quiet cuz I never feel comfortable, and I'm never comfortable because of how quiet I am. Since I havent opened up yet, I'm p sure a lot of the people think I'm creepy and a social failure.. and because of that, i'm too scared to talk a lot of the time in case they judge me further. When I get out words, they often dont make sense or im so nervous and stumbly. I cant stand it.

I know that if somehow I got into a cycle where people thought I was cool + liked me, I'd be more comfortable and start talking more, thus 'becoming' more cool even to myself, and gaining more confidence.

2854,"For everyone who commented no matter the circumstances, I just wanted to say Thank you for all the replies. I also want to personally follow that up with this statement. Last night I was not in a good mood, not from your comments but that when you put your best of effort in something and constantly get tossed to the side, your dream at becoming something fades and it hurts. I don't hate the Marine Corps and I don't blame it for my Discharge, I've never tried to make myself the victim and I've always told the truth on what has happened. From my point of view I know I should be a Marine, that discipline part is true, by week 8 I should have had it.

But you have to understand I was young, and I've never lost someone who meant more to me then myself. He was not just a best friend, bit he was actually my brother. I felt like that information didn't need to be said, but he was my younger brother being stupid on a motorcycle. When I found out he died a part of me did too, but I never wanted to go home or stop training. I wanted to be a Marine and I was so close. Unfortunately I broke 2 days later and made a big mistake, I know I'm not perfect but at this point, I have nothing left.

I'm broke, homeless and I have only my mother left. I know what I've said to people on here was out of line and fucked up, but I'm in the situation where I dug a hole and I'm using the best possible steps to work around and out of it.

I made one mistake after another and it's just at this point I don't feel like anything is worth it if I can't be in the Marine Corps, my Platoon and I went through some rough shit and we pulled each other out of it, and I felt like I had a family. When I was dropped I was lost, especially with the death of my brother Vincent I wasn't prepared to handle all of that in that temporary moment. It didn't last, I continued to train but I failed myself. I can see why most of you said what you said and I did listen to it all. I may not have shown I understood it but I did.

I'm not a bad kid, and I sure as hell don't hate the Marines and their Veterans, I just make one stupid move after the next and if what I've been doing isn't good enough, maybe I just don't deserve the right to live, and that brings me to make next move. In 4 months I'm gonna say fuck it and put that barrel against my temple on the one year anniversary of my discharge and I'll clock out, after all, I'm a failure right.

4113,"Advice from someone who has recovered from Health Anxiety. Hey all,

I know how rough health anxiety is. Trust me. I struggled with health anxiety years ago. I racked up almost 20K worth of unnecessary medical tests, labs, and appointments (turns out if you're in the US and don't have insurance, anxiety is expensive). I had every symptom that convinced me I had any and every malignant disease out there, irrational ""what if"" thoughts, and feelings of unreality 24/7.

Since then, I've fully recovered...no more lingering physical symptoms, no more panic attacks, and honestly... life has been great. I wanted to provide some hope to others who are struggling.

Health anxiety is sinister for 2 reasons.

1. Anxiety leads to physical symptoms that truly mimic malignant disease. Its hard to decipher what is causing what.
2. Because your nerves are sensitized, you will naturally think the worse case scenario is the most likely. Hence, anxiety stays alive.

Compound this with Dr. Google, and you are certainly in for a painful cycle that is hard to get out of.

Now, to be fully transparent...since recovering, I've left my corporate job and have been helping others overcome as well. I essentially take them step-by-step to full recovery. That means no more lingering physical symptoms, no more ""what-if"" thoughts, or feelings of unreality. And their progress has been incredible. Making transformations

But before you think I'm doing some self promotion, I'm not. I'm here to just give you the truth about health anxiety...which is you can fully recover. I know how easy it is to think that recovery is not possible. Especially when you're on forums with others struggling.

Here are some major (and albeit) obvious tips to help you on your journey to overcome.

1. Learn how anxiety can lead to physical symptoms that seem scary. This stops you from constantly doubting your doctors, and stops you from finding answers on google that don't exist.
2. Recognize that anxiety also influences your thoughts. Not just your physical symptoms. Thats why its so hard to accept that your symptoms are just anxiety.

If you want to know more about my recovery, and how to recover, I made a youtube video to really give you insight on my recovery and goes deeper on giving you steps.

544,"My psychiatrist suggested I may have PTSD but I feel like the things I experienced aren't ""traumatic"" enough There are two independent things that she told me I seem to have PTSD from.

The first is my marriage and it's premature demise which left me divorced at 23. It was entirely my fault, and I spent the last five months of that relationship in complete isolation and constant anxiety, getting screamed at with insults that made me wish he would just hit me instead.

The other thing was getting laid off, coincidentally 4 days after I dropped five grand to move out of the apartment I shared with my ex (we still lived together for six months after he filed for divorce). It was my first job out of college, and I've been there for a grand total of 8 months. I loved that job, and the layoff was totally sudden, so much so that my department had a new employee who started Monday and got laid off on Friday. But I was lucky, and got a new job that I don't hate and came with the 10K raise. So really, I should feel happy about the whole thing, but I guess I am somehow traumatized instead.

Certainly getting divorced end losing a job within a six-month time would be stressful for anyone, but I feel like a fraud if I claim that it gave me PTSD when there are people pills gone through way more traumatic things. Like, you get PTSD from being raped or your child dying or something like that. I just got yelled at a little and was unemployed for a month. That seems like nothing in comparison. But I guess I have expressed the typical symptoms, like nightmares, flashbacks, anxiety, paranoia, etc. But even though I have the symptoms I still feel like it shouldn't count cuz my situations aren't ""real trauma""

You are right,  they have a checklist of B.S, that they give to you but invariably you will find those who listen.   I am on total disability now and I am thinking about starting my own business with a niche but I am going to hand that off to someone else.     The spirit is willing but the issue is a huge handicap but I do not want this to consume my life and defeat me.   I have learned I have more than a few cents and more sense if I believe in my self.

The best way to cops is to make schedule and set some goals and make them harder as you go along or can tolerate.   I figure if people with Down's Disease can make a difference, so can I.  In fact,  I have and that was the happiest part of life.   Going beyond whatever obstacles got in my way.  I do not have to quantify or quantify the issues but they are serious.

My brother Jeff has been very ill for about 13 years,  I am guessing,  but we have to find a niche and oh by the way,  people need to check out VETS PREVAIL.  They give you instruction on how to deal with stressors and at the end of the day,  you can earn points to a gift card that can range from 100 to 150 dollars while working on coping  mechanisms.   People may not understand you or how meds can affect mood and sleeping patterns, which in turn affect our waking hours and the cycle repeats.

So take care of yourself.   Don't just and try and find another if you are divorced as a kind of panacea.   But do find yourself.  Whether you are religious or not you can do this.   I have called a few times during which the stress of living in my car hand me ranting mad and disillusioned.

Anyway the ambulance arrived and there was nothing more they could do to help him. I remember everything so vividly. To this day I still have dreams about him, not bad ones, just ones he appears in as if he never died.

Spc. Brandon Garrison found her in the dark days afterward and provided the details — the details a mother fears but needs — of Wilson’s last moments after a Taliban attack in Korengal Valley in March 2007.

The futile attempt to save Wilson, the blood, the coldness of imminent death. It was all there in Garrison’s account, and he provided the memories she clung to for years.

“I just needed to know. It is a knife wound so deep you just have to know every aspect or you can’t breathe,” Wilson’s mother, Ilka Halliday said.

Except none of it was true.

Garrison’s war lies are unraveling, eight years later, after soldiers who were with Wilson when he died came forward.

Garrison was not by Wilson’s side when he died, and had instead spent his Afghanistan deployment inside the wire as a vehicle parts clerk.

The false story of the infantry soldier’s death has exposed the pain such deceit can cause for survivors. For Wilson’s mother and his family, the sting of lies and loss has not been diminished by the passing of years.

But the lie has also unearthed questions about Garrison’s other war claims and cast a shadow over the well-meaning support he has received as a wounded veteran.

In Kansas, where he lives, 29-year-old Garrison is well-known as a combat vet who walks with a cane and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury and other health problems he says are related to burn-pit exposure. He recently received a donated home based on his status as an honorably discharged veteran and was given a service dog.

To some who served with him in Afghanistan, he was a lackluster soldier who lied about his Army war record and embellished his combat injuries.

His supervisor in Korengal Valley called him a ""compulsive liar.""

1036,"What do I do? My husband suffers from anxiety, which I have known since before we got married. Lately it has gotten pretty bad. Tonight he called our 5 year old a disgusting little girl for eating some butter, and went across the street to drink with the neighbor instead of hanging out with our kids (who are a pain, I admit). When he got back, he started to rather drunkenly tell me he constantly has these fears and worries nagging, eating at him, and that he hasn't really enjoyed a single day in the last 4 years. Obviously this is very worrisome, and I have tried many times to get him to therapy, but he is very anti-meds and thinks that's all they will do. Tonight he told me it would help if I cleaned the fucking kitchen and acted like I gave a shit about the house.

Whew......ok, I clean ALL THE GOTDAMN TIME. He does not. I'm trying to blow it off as a symptom of the anxiety, but as always when we get into an argument, he downplays everything I try to say as me being dismissive, defensive, or pouting. When this was said about the kitchen, I got out of bed and cleaned the damn kitchen. He says I don't listen. I'm tired of this. He says he doesn't have it in him anymore. His anxiety is starting to affect our kids (our 7 year old also has a diagnosed anxiety issue, and I blame my husband for a lot of it, fair or not), and our ability to function as a family.

While the doctors I've seen help me fine or determine the root cause of my different stress points and anxiety, the actual fix process, if you will, is speaking with vets who were at the exact point of deployment as I was. What I mean is, while I respect those that served in Vietnam helps me open up to certain events, they still weren't were I was. One of my areas of difficulty was Beirut Lebanon 1983. If you weren't in my unit or broader, if you didn't fully understand what we faced, just being a combat vet wasn't close enough to the fire to understand what I experience. Maybe I'm being super critical or maybe I'm putting up walls to say one can't possibly understand. This is the hardest part of recovery, letting someone in. If the drug can help reduce or suppress those walls I continually put up, that will at least open up the possibility of letting someone in. I don't know if my comments today helped or allowed me to share my feeling on what I think any drug should do. But I wouldn't want a drug that suppress everything that I'm going through.

I don’t have any memory from when I was 0-4, I’m not sure about it but anyways my mom says when we would go to loud places like the circus, I would start crying. She tried her best to know what was wrong with me but due to a lack of knowledge and the doctors not having knowledge about my anxiety disorder (Don’t ask me about that doctors part) my mom didn’t know what was wrong.

I’ve posted about this incident before, but I’ve been thinking for the past week... is my response to the incident overblown, or is it a result of a deeper issue?

***
To sum the incident:
I’m sick. I take a twenty second break while my coworker takes care of the customers. I notice an agitated customer. I assume she’s in a hurry. I call her over to help. She accuses me of not wanting to help her. I tell her that I’m sick. She proceeds to scream in my face, accusing me of not wanting to help her,  not wanting to be there, of daydreaming, and that she hopes I get sent home. I’m left speechless because none of that is true, I literally offered to help her. She continues to repeat the above statements over and over — throughout the entire transaction. I scan her stuff in silence. She gets increasingly aggressive, now pointing in my face. I’m still having a freeze reaction. She leaves once the transaction is over.

Her friends refused to even look at us for some reason. When my coworker finished, they bolted out of the store without a word.

***
I didn’t know how to react during and after her explosion. I started experiencing PTSD symptoms two weeks after and I’m still experiencing it almost a year and a half later. I will be seeing a psychiatrist in late May, but for now, I feel like my reaction to this is abnormal. I know there are CS worker who have been sworn at, called derogatory names,  physically assaulted... and they didn’t react as badly.

5513,"This is ruining my life. I need to make a change. Title says it all. This is ruining my life and making me feel like life isn't even worth living. All I do is obsess and worry and browse the internet. I'm 27 F, and in the past week I have gone from worrying about brain tumours to MS to early onset Parkinsons to liver cancer, blood cancer, Meneire's disease, diabetes, and other illnesses.

I've been like this my whole life. I don't even know why, but ever since I've been a kid I've been worried about my health. I was a semi sick child, but nothing life threatening or horrible. I have been seeing a therapist off and on since I've been 14 and it does help, though I haven't gone in a few weeks.

2 months ago I began getting vertigo. Doctor told me it was an inner ear problem, and the whole thing made my anxiety completely spiral out of control. I haven't stopped thinking about whats wrong with me or worried about not being dizzy for longer than 15 minutes in the last 10 weeks. The room spinning vertigo is gone, I'm just left with some random dizzy spells and disequilibrium/unsteadiness. I was convinced the doctor missed something, so they agreed to do some blood work and booked an MRI. They don't seem overly concerned but said they will do it. I'm waiting for the MRI, but just got news back from my bloodwork. Apparently it's all normal expect for my B12, which is elevated (cut off is 950 and I'm 1048).. This is pretty unusual, since B12 is normally low if anything. I have been taking B12 supplements, so I'm going to try to assume that's what caused it (the nurse told me about the blood results and the doctor has yet to follow up, so I don't know what to do about it besides stop taking the supplement) but of course my crazy self went on Google and found out high B12 can be indicative of blood or liver cancers and is really serious. Cue freak out.

I'm just done. I'm so done living like this. I don't know what the follow up will be for the B12, if anything, but I'm just going to be sitting here wanting to browse the internet in hopes of making myself feel better when in reality I never will. I will sit here and think about every bodily sensation and worry about feeling off balance, and worry about something sinister going on and picturing all the horrible scenarios that are going to happen and how I'm going to die young and suffer and leave my children motherless.

&amp;#x200B;

I just have to make a change. Even if I do have blood cancer or liver cancer (my current fear), there isn't anything I can do about it. It's not like worrying is going to make it go away, so why do I do this to myself? I can't do another day like this, searching for answers and being constantly scared. I've booked an appointment with my psychologist for this Wednesday and I am vowing to myself to get off Google and never go back on for answers. I don't know what else to do yet, but I feel this is a good start.

6685,"People with an on/off switch for emotions are heavily miss understood in my opinion. I have this ""on/off switch"" that is not commonly talked about. I think a large problem is people with this condition don't usually talk about their side of it for one big reason, it's kinda embarrassing. Number one misconception I think needs to be addressed is (at least for me) I'm not a sociopath I'm actually over emotional. That's why I have the option to shut off. It's not some kind of gift I was just born with. I accumulated the ability through years of emotional child hood trauma. Also it's not like when say option it's a complete option. It's more like a fight to not shut off. It's easier to shut off because the emotional turmoil of the fight to keep my emotions is stronger then the emotion that I'm subconsciously trying to suppress. Also when my emotional suppression takes place it's not the one emotion in question thats suppressed it's all emotions, and empathy. Also when the shut down takes place it's not like my emotions just get shut down and that's it. My logical and rational thinking, as well as my understanding of the psyche and and subconscious dramatically increases to an unreal level. It's almost like a high, you feel powerful and untouchable, you can quickly make up any lie and make it 100% real very quickly. You can make complicated decisions that would change the course of your life in split seconds. And it's almost like everything in you body goes into complete survival mode, meaning any decisions you make are ultimately for bettering your situation, other people who are hurt by this decision are just seen as collateral (I know it sounds fucked up but that's the way my head works when I shut off). It's almost like a completely different person takes over my life when this happens, and the real me becomes my subconscious telling me that saying or doing this is a bad idea and will hurt someone, but the other person in charge ignores me. And most people who I know who suffer from this didn't wanna be like this, it's just something that stems from trauma. It's scary for me when this happens because I know what I'm doing is wrong and I want my emotions back, but the other me is just so strong and rational it's hard for me to take my humanity back. Another fact when I shut off I'm usually shut off anywhere from a few hours to a week. The longest I shut off for was a little over a year. When your emotions are gone for over a few days I've noticed my life becomes very contradictory, there's the side of me fighting to get them back and there's the side fighting to keep them suppressed, it's like living with a real life demon who actually thinks it's helping you, when in reality it's breaking friendships and burning family bridges. The last thing I have to say is no one will ever understand you or the inner conflict you go through if you can shut off. I'm sure theirs people out there who don't mind it. Their probably very successful individuals, they might be seen narcissists, or sociopaths, but I look at them with pitty rather then anger, or fear. While I know there is alot of people who were actually born unable to feel, or born manipulative and unempathetic, I know that a few of them are like me. Because what I see is a man/woman who gave up the fight and let the demon win. They are addicts, striving off power and the construction of a ""successful"" life, ultimately not even aware of the destruction they leave in their wake. Any ways just my two cents, you can do what you like with this information.

P.S. I have no real knowledge of sociopaths or narcissists, but I know about the emotional suppression.

I grew up with a father that used various drugs, my mother used prescription pills and a brother that turned criminal and early got a liking to drugs too. We were poor, there never was a ray of sunshine because new clouds of shit always came around.


My earliest memories is me running from home, because my mother yelled at me to do so - because my dad was going to beat her. She told me to run to my aunt and make her call the police. I remember running, but not arriving there.


I became the quiet kid, the kid that tried to fix everything and not cause any trouble. But when I felt down, it felt like I had nobody to turn to. (I remember embracing the pain, and hoping it would get worse. I don't know why.)
I had my mother, but she was mostly sleeping in her bed or reading books in bed. I never told anyone outside my family either. I remember being in school, and people were complaining about things that seemed like nothing but I never could tell anyone.


I remember feeling so horribly sad, and I went to talk with my mother. And she was high on the pills, because she said she saw angels but it was just light flashes from the cars driving by our window. And that hurt so much.
I was crying and she didin't take care of me.


When I got into my teen-years, I hated my father and my brother. Everytime they came around, they always brought problems home. Always turned to a scream-fest and me being stuck infront of my PC - hoping that they don't come here.


I never got beaten by my dad, but my dad beat everyone else. ( I can't remember how severe it was, but I don't think that anyone got hospitalized. ) And my mom told me that I should feel glad/lucky that he never did, because I was his son.


I finally got to meet a therapist, I cried and did what I thought was nessecary to get past this.
But it won't let me go, I just want to be healthy and be a normal person. I want to stop crying everyday, I want to feel good enough and not being so fucking pitiful. I was so strong, I thought.


Then I tried cannabis, and I realised that not all drugs are bad and.. It helps. I became addicted to it in a way, I managed my school but felt like smoking was what made my everyday life work. It felt like it affected the days afterward too.


Then.. One night, I got a text. I was supposed to meet a guy, I did - and he and his friend scared the life out of me. I think that I could easily fucked them up(I was -very- muscular.), but I was high and.. Something snapped in my head. I froze. I took some punches, told the truth and they wanted to beat someone else now.
 (But it backfired in two hours and they wanted to meet me and prob beat me more.)


When I left, I was glad that I had not pissed myself or started crying. But my head was racing, I had never been so alert in my life. Adrenaline.
I did not realise that.. That was probarly the beginning of my PTSD. I became paranoid, I moved 2 days after that.


7 months later, I was in the military. I was not forced, but I thought it was a good idea and a nice life experience.
2,5-3 months in, it hit me. I started flinching, I started dreaming nightmares, I became dull in my head, I once grappled with a dude and.. I became so furious, and he had to hold me because, if he had let me go earlier than he did. I maybe would have done something rash. ( I can get angry, but I -never- act on it.. I did when I was a teen, but very rarely. )


I had to drop out, I felt that I was a failure. I came back to my country where I was born. (Neighbour country.)
I started living with my GF and.. That is where everything turned to shit.


I have stopped crying while writing, so that's nice. But I must have been occupied.. Less than a hour, but more than 20 minutes.


I have forgot to mention so much. Such as, I stopped being happy after the military. My symptoms worsened.
I did not know what was wrong with me back then, now I do.
It felt like I was at fault, but I know now that it's just a illness or whatever you may call it.
(English is not my primary language.)


I'm going to talk to a therapist again, I'm waiting for a call. (Within 10 days.)
I try to be transparent how I feel with my GF but it's hard and sometimes I want to just fight it through without her help, because I don't want to take even more from her than she already gives me.


I found this sub yesterday, I was looking for a place to ventilate. I can't keep crashing and crying infront of my awesome girlfriend, I -must- get better because I don't want to lose her. (She really is the best, my gf during military cheated twice. Nice.) Anyhow, I read a post and.. The person writing felt the same way I did, I could see myself in several other posts, people who have it better or worse. And I felt glad, that I'm not crazy and you people also feel like I do.

The rest of the time, my nightmares are just random, horrible things my brain can think of. I don’t even know how I’m somehow thinking of these things to generate a nightmare. They’re nothing like my life, my trauma, or things I’ve seen/read during the day.

Does this make me high risk in the eyes of the Army and some health providors sure. I know when I need help and when my depression is spiraling out of control now.

All that said, whoever is making the Suicide training is not getting information from people like me, people like me can tell you the training is ineffective, and mostly not helpful to help identify when someone is in trouble.

I believe the training is check in the box, it seems the highers are more concerned that the public might want to get in their business a little more and find out why so many men and women are committing suicide now.

How do we fix this? There is no band-aid or blanket to fix the issue. The more pressure you place and more personal space you take away from some people the more you push them to that edge. Others need to be brought into a circle and feel like they have a safe haven.

To say suicide is selfish is not helping anyone who might be looking for away for help. My mindset just like so many others, was with me gone as a burden those around me will be better off. Some do it for selfish reasons, but many times you don't share that persons pains and burdens to make that judgement. That is one place to start, stop isolating and beating down someone who is already drowning.

As far as the MRT mindset that seems to be guiding this question. MRT is great but flawed, if you are going through the process with only yourself, it is easy to ""trap"" yourself even further and verigy your original stance.

The top spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard killed himself in desperation, fearing his 30-year service career would end in disgrace, with a court-martial & loss of pension.
COL Ernie Blanchard IV, 46, wasn't charged with rape or sodomy or any of the sex crimes. What he was ""guilty"" of was poor judgment by telling sexist joke. An enraged girl @ the Coast Guard Academy demanded the captain be punished.
This was reported as the joke that cost the COL his life:
COL Blanchard addressed cadets & guests assembled in the Old Wardroom dining hall @ the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn. To break the ice, Blanchard unwisely chose what he thought was a harmless joke to lighten the mood in the room.
“I saw a cadet's fiancée wearing a brooch featuring maritime signal flags. The fiancée told him the flags meant, I love you. What they really said .was permission granted to lay alongside."" The audience groaned.
Fellow Capt William Stillman expressed the academy's displeasure to Capt Blanchard, in three days, Capt. Blanchard issued a formal apology letter. It read, in part: ""Us old sea dogs need to adapt & change the way we have always done things.""
The Coast Guard public affairs officer hoped the matter had ""blown over. However, it had not. A contingent of infuriated girls from the academy pressured the top brass to take further action.
To his shock & amazement, Blanchard found himself the target of a criminal probe. The father of two teenage daughters, with some 30 years of military service @ stake, offered his resignation to the Coast Guard in order to save his pension benefits. It was refused.
He returned to his Virginia home & walked out into the backyard. Holding his Smith & Wesson revolver in his right hand, he placed the gun to his head & fired.

I had impacted lower wisdom tooth extracted by surgery on June 2019. This is what my retromolar area looks like today. The mass complained is along where the parotid glands are located - says my oral surgeon.

It's difficult for me now not to bite my cheek now because of the underlying nodular growing mass, hence those increased keratinization (I hope those aren't something more than that) I'd personally prefer those to be excised along with the underlying swelling.

I made a follow up check up to the oral surgeon who extracted my wisdom tooth and he dismissed it as just ""cheekbite lesions"" without even figuring out why I am biting my cheek to begin with and if I'm really that paranoid he would just refer me to any ENT, which he did.

I consulted an ENT. He scheduled me for a contrast CT scan next friday and for subsequent biopsy of the mass just to make sure.

There is at least a happy ending though, i'm sure even my wife might agree to this; we are still married and have been married for 35 years and counting;  yeah, HOOAH to that one.  I actually presented my wife, this past Christmas (2016), with a 4K Diamond, designed by me, so it's one of a kind and cannot and will not be reproduced again in our lifetime.  So, how did I take my wife for granted?  it all began when she opened her Nail Salon in S. Korea 16 years ago and while I was still humping it on active duty.  I retired a few years after she opened her business and began down a long and dark path- just doing what ever the hello I wanted to do;  she said she couldn't reach me no matter how hard she tried. I was feeling deprived, alone, neglected and perhaps put on the back burner for later use by her.  In the end, it was merely my own selfish attitude in which took us down that long - dark road; the first step in solving a problem is to admit you have a problem.  So, we end up split apart- me living and working in Virginia at Fort Belvoir for the U.S. Government, while she remained in S. Korea working in and running her shop- we needed the extra money for tuition fees for our sons who were in college;  We still believe in higher education and I'm sure our sons would tell you they didn't believe they had much of a choice in that matter- actually because they didn't.   Anyway, as for taking her for granted, I need to tell the truth here;  I really didn't care at the time, when I was totally lost anyway, what anyone thought about my conduct.

We have been in a serious relationship for more than a year, and I do wish it can last for many many years. The time we have been together however, has been enough to notice some ""patterns"" on his general health that lead to my wonder.

My partner is fit, active for the most part, bellow the 25 year old mark, and has a decent diet overall (except when he gets very depressive, then it's reduced to cigarettes and water), however, he experiences general physical illness very often, in winter, it's almost as if colds don't really take a break. It get's very accentuated when he's not mentally well, the anxiety triggers lots of issues leading to no eating or trowing up, also shaking, chest pains, major sleep deprivation and fainting on more extreme scenarios... of course this, and the smoking habit, surely don't contribute to a healthy body, but, even when he's doing good on a mental level and stable, he still gets lots of strong headaches, colds with some fever, and random body pains.

He doesn't really complain much about this things, obviously they are minor comparing to other bigger things, and truth is he does have other health conditions (not mental) that are properly diagnosed and checked and do cause some of this daily symptoms. Even so, I was wondering if other people that suffer with chronic mental health illness, specially related to schizophrenia, also face this kind of general indisposition, and if so, how often? Did you ever faced any difficulty in getting some treatment/medical attention for it on your health system, like, not being taken that seriously? Because it has happened with him, it wasn't indeed anything that serious but at least it deserved some kind of examination from the doctor, which didn't happen at all.",1.0,reddit schizophrenia

6311,"[Advice] I (21M) have suffered from depression for years. I have recently been diagnosed with ADHD, but I’m about to fail out of college. Please excuse any grammar mistakes.

To give some background, I have always had issues in school. I come from a family where my two older brothers are in med school and my older sister is working on her masters. In high school I was on student government, an active volunteer, socially adapted, varsity football captain, and involved in my church. I finished with a 3.5 GPA and 32 ACT at a competitive high school.

I was also diagnosed with depression in high school after reporting feelings of focus issues, severe insomnia, an over active mind, and feelings of worthlessness.

I am a third year student in a midwestern state school. I struggled through my first two semesters of college without picking a major. 2.4 GPA.

 In the first semester of my second year of college I took a medical leave late in the semester to “sort out” my mental illness and issues. My parents, my therapist, and I didn’t come up with a sound plans. I didn’t return for the spring semester because I was taking a few community college courses.

I returned to the same school in Fall 2018 feeling reinvigorated. I declare as a CS major feeling ready to take on the world. I took 15 credits, and failed 8 of them. I am placed on academic probation with a 1.7 GPA. I feel defeated.

I come home for winter break to my parents angry, disappointed, and exhausted. I explain to them that I still feel unfocused, unmotivated, stubborn, and fatigued. I see my internal medicine doctor and my therapist, and they agree to send me to see a new psychiatrist. My new psychiatrist sends me to see a neurofeedback specialist to test for ADD/ADHD. After 7 hours of testing (yikes) my psychiatrist concludes that I have SAD and ADHD. I am immediately treated with 300mg Wellbutrin before being sent back to college.

It takes another few weeks for the Wellbutrin to kick in. At this point, I’m still struggling in school. Failing to turn stuff in, procrastination, not being able to study, and hyper focusing and being productive with random nonsense for hours at a time. I felt no different and at the end of my rope.

It isn’t until 4 weeks into the semester that I am prescribed 30mg Vyvanse. I notice an immediate change in the way that I am able to structure my thoughts. It felt like the things I had to accomplish automatically turned into a list. It was a relief, but it may have been to late.

At this point I am weeks behind in school. I’m failing most of my classes, and I have avoided my professors. I haven’t applied for student accommodation services because I forgot to. I know that my parents know, and I am worried that this is my last shot before they cut me off. I feel that I’ve abused our relationship and wasted time/money/resources/energy/love.
I am worried.

Has anyone else experienced this or something similar before?

This story is relevant, but I’m more concerned about figuring out the difference between sadness and depression. So even if you don’t read the story, I’d still like your help.

About a few months ago in the summer, I (17f) was always working and never had time to do things. I went to work, then went home, and did everything over again. I was getting pretty sad, because I didn’t really have time to hang out with friends. Then I quit my job, but all my friends were busy, so I couldn’t do anything with them. So there I was, completely free, but nothing to do. I became very sad, I felt hopeless and everything I use to love doing, made me more sad.

So I went to reddit just to rant and talk to people. I found a guy, and we completely hit it off. Stuff started progressing on a romantic level. I was so happy, and it was truly the happiest I’d ever been. But just a few days ago, he told me that we couldn’t do this anymore. I’ve been crying non stop for days. I’m uninterested in everything again, I feel like how I did a few months ago, but 10x worse.

I don’t have anyone in my life to talk to about this. What do I do? Am I depressed? Or am I just sad about a break up?",1.0,reddit mentalhealth
9063,"I have stated before that I believe suicidal Soldiers separations should be expedited. The majority of the time the military is the Soldiers main problem causing them suicidal thoughts. I have never seen a suicidal Soldier moved to another unit and it doesn't make sense to me, why would you move him/her from the only support system they currently have to somewhere they don't know anyone? If the chain of command is responsible for the suicidal tendencies, there is probably a pattern and the chain of command should be relieved. I would need a strong recommendation from the Chaplain and/or behavioral health before I transferred a suicidal Soldier to another unit.

Moving other ""at risk"" Soldiers to other units has been going on forever, it's called a rehabilitative transfer. It gives the Soldier an opportunity for a ""fresh start"". If the Soldier cannot recover it is much easier to separate them from the service because you have exhausted all your resources to try and help the Soldier.",0.0,rallypoint nock2000

ALIVE TO GOD IN JESUS
While success boosts your confidence; mistakes and failures have the potential to do the opposite. When you try to break an addiction; respond with patience instead of anger, tell the truth instead of lies, and practice humility over pride and failure. An addiction can tear down your motivation, increase your guilt, and make you question, “Is this even worth it? Will I ever see a difference? Will I struggle with this forever?”

“Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 6:11)

Paul tells you the truth. We live in a fallen world and will inevitably struggle with our sinful nature. But you are no longer a slave to sin. Your old nature was crucified long ago on the cross, and Jesus offered you victory the moment He rose from the dead.

Even when you mess up and give in to sin, even when your guilt is at an all-time high, and even when you have failed for the millionth time in a row, you still can know. Yes, the fight is worth it. Yes, I will see a difference. Your struggle won’t last forever, because Jesus broke the power of sin forevermore. Sin no longer triumphs, and it no longer dictates the way we live.

As God’s chosen people and with the help of the Holy Spirit, we must keep fighting back. Because we are free from the grip of sin, and in the end, victory is ours.

Is there anything in your life that has left you feeling discouraged, guilty, and unmotivated to fight back?
Do you need Prayer? We are here to pray with you.
“Heavenly Father, if I am ever feeling discouraged, guilty, and unmotivated to fight back, I will call upon You for my help. With the Holy Spirit’s help, I will be the overcomer and walk in victory, no matter what it is. I will behold Your word, take Your word in my mouth, and walk out loving and following You. You are my strength, and I take Your words for victory. I know my victory in You by reading and staying in Your word. Thank You for this victory from You. In Jesus’ name, Amen.”

In a deadly double-cross, five CIA officers, two security contractors and a Jordanian intelligence officer were killed at the remote base in Khost. Six other CIA officers were wounded.
LaBonte was 35 years old when he died, ending a career that included service in the military and a series of law enforcement jobs. He left behind a wife and young daughter.
“He was a pretty talented guy,” said his father, who described the son as “intelligent, complex and an incredible athlete.”
He was a “man determined to be a part of the solution to the unrest in our world,” his mother said.
His parents declined to discuss what he did for the agency. But the elder LaBonte said his son had served in Iraq, Afghanistan and Amman, Jordan, his last posting before he died in Afghanistan. Father and son talked about the perils of his job.
“I don’t think he feared death,” David LaBonte said. “He faced it.”

As a joke he filmed a Snapchat of him taking out a knife and putting it up to our dogs throat with a creepy smile on his face and sent it to my sister cause he knew she would freak out of course she did and she showed me the video. When we got mad and confronted him he just blew it off and said that we were getting way too mad over it and it was just a joke and to relax. Next thing that weirded me out is that he has a horror movie mask that he just hangs out in and wears while he plays with his knife collection I know that’s not really that serious but it just seems kinda concerning cause I feel like he enjoys it a little too much and might be fantasying about murder. Lastly is his anger issues have been getting out of control last week he got into a fight with my sister and her boyfriend, the bathroom door got broke, he punched a hole in the wall, I had to try and contain him cause he really wanted to beat the shit out of my sister boyfriend, he emotionally traumatized and physically assaulted my sister, when I was holding him down he kept screaming at the top of his lungs like someone having a psychotic rage, he looked my sister in the eyes and just screamed in her face. I was so scared I almost had to choke him out or call the cops it got that bad. My sister was so traumatized she ended up moving out the next day and she is living currently with her friend.

Well luckily I get unlucky and find out she has a boyfriend. Apparently it was all a big secret and they were gonna make it official at the prom. At least I saved myself from the embarrassment.

Now I didn't really get too sad because of it at first because I try my best not to be a jealous person even though for some whatever genetic reason I'm an extremely jealous person. I just try to hide it and control it. Well, until I found this boyfriend of hers was one of the biggest losers in the world. I'm not going to go into detail but the guy was needy as fuck. And also bully material. But then again, I tried my best to brush it off.

This threw me into a pretty sad state that I was sure I just couldn't out. I was angry, sad and tired at the same time. Just until a trip with a few colleagues. Here I met a really interesting girl. So I do thing and by the end of the day she asks me to sleep with her - only literal. So everything was going extremely well. Too good actually. This goes on for all the nights and she seems really into me. This was the shot to break the curse. Apparently it did not happen since when we got back from the trip she got a boyfriend. Then she cheats on the guy with another guy to which she cheats with another. I'm not even sure on what number she is, but it's definitely not ok.

I could say that I got lucky with since she's not a person I would like to be dating. It still left me with a bitter taste and a very depressive state. I didn't want to do anything and all life lost meaning. Long story short : I experience something I wish to never experience again. Having the worst day in my life for a straight 40 days. Every single day was worse than the one before. But I manage to break through with leveling up my favorite defense mechanism - not caring and humour. It has gotten to such a high level people actually started so much more. I became somewhat of a comedian. I was the funniest guy. Only problem is that was the only people saw. The Pagliacii effect hit me.

Now the girl with the idiot boyfriend actually broke up with me. Big surprise, I know. I was wondering how they even got together in the first place. ""This is my chance"" I thought.  This time she seemed even more into me. I was sure this time I can break the curse. But today I found out she got a new boyfriend. Another complete loser. Like what the actual fuck they don't even get along well, at fucking all!!!. The probability of this happening were practically 0. Yet somehow it still happened. Just so life can spit in my face. He's such a fucking moron. I'm trying not to be jealous but it's pretty hard. I feel like I can't keep this anymore.

Basically the title - is this something that is common amongst the depressed? And if so, do you think it derives more from depression itself or something else that depression caused? I haven’t delved deep into this, so I’d love any reputable scientific articles that address this.

Ever since the onset of my severe depression, I’ve been increasingly having difficulties forming sentences - and we’re talking about super menial, basic sentences here. Till now, I’ve always shrugged it off as a temporary manifestation of my depression, and that it’ll go away - but honestly, rather than it being grounded on something, it’s just an arbitrary opinion I've been using to comfort myself with.

Anyone else relate to this? It’s something that has been affecting my life pretty drastically (I’ve become a lot more insecure, quiet, isolated and gloomy) - and unfortunately, I’m not financially in a good enough spot to consult a doctor about this, so the internet will have to do for now.

I started flying when I was 8 and never had an issue until I was about 16 or 17 and experienced some pretty rough turbulence over the Atlantic. I've flown a handful of times after that, but in recent years, my anxiety has gotten worse and evolved in ways that makes the idea of flying difficult.

Last year, I was meant to fly to New Orleans with my Wife, but came down with a nasty cold a couple days before the trip and had to stay behind. Miraculously, a day after she left, I was fine. This leads me to believe my anxiety was behind the cold to a certain degree. Now, I'm supposed to fly down to New Orleans one-way, by myself in mid March so that I can take the drive back home with my brother in law.

This is something I not only want to do, but *need* to do. I know that I can't be paralyzed by my fear forever. My main fears are feeling trapped; my stomach drops whenever I think of the flight attendant closing the big door and knowing I'm past the point of no return; I'm also scared of something happening in the air that would prevent us from having a safe landing, such as the landing gear not deploying or something; the idea of circling in the air, not knowing whether or not we'll be able to land safely drives me insane.

I plan on seeing my doctor for some anxiety meds before the flight, but I know I can't count on them to fully cure me of my anxiety. I don't want to limp onto this plane and be a miserable human being on the verge of full-blown panic the entire time. I really want to enjoy my trip. It's really going to force me to step outside of my comfort zone in many different ways and it's important to me that I don't back out of it.

3773,"Social Anxiet: I am scared of my roommates Edit: sorry for the error in the title!!

Tldr: I am so scared to meet my roommates in communal rooms that I completely shut myself off, avoids using the bathroom or kitchen and lead a miserable life.

Hi everyone,
So as most twenty-somethings I‘ve lived in shared apartments all my life. It never went great. I usually move in, highly motivated to have good relations with my roommates and nearly always they have been nice and welcoming people. But after a few months I slowly start avoiding them, I don’t use the kitchen if I hear someone else using it and stay in my room for hours on end.

Currently my situation is really bad. I got into a fight with one of my roommates because he fucked up the contract and now we all lost our home and we have to move out by August. I am proud because I stood my ground in the fight and asked for what‘s rightfully mine. But ever since then I find myself being extremely anxious when I’m at home. I don’t use the kitchen anymore. All I‘m eating is take out. And even when I need to use the bathroom I wait for hours and hours until I‘m sure everyone’s asleep and I can finally go without meeting anyone in the communal rooms (I have to go through the kitchen into the bathroom).

The roommate I got into a fight with uses the kitchen and the living room a lot, he‘s almost never in his own room. Which makes everything so much worse. I can’t leave my room ever. I‘m scared when I return home from work. I get nervous that I‘ll meet someone in the corridor or someone will hear me and try to talk to me. We have a shared balcony which I never use even though the weather is beautiful.

My quality of life has decreased so much. I feel terrible, I‘m eating junk food that I cannot afford and watch Netflix all day to forget that I am trapped. I‘m too scared to make a sound.

I have a tendency to get depressed. I‘ve been in therapy many times before and this feeling of being trapped makes me so scared that I‘ll fall right back into it. It‘s so horrible.

But the idea of meeting my roommate is even worse. On the rare occasion I see him, we say hello very curtly and that’s it. I feel a lot of tension in these situations and cannot handle them.

Afghanistan's main intelligence agency said Wednesday that Mullah Omar has been dead for more than two years. The U.S. had placed a $10 million bounty on him.

Since 1984, the U.S. government has paid out more than $125 million to over 80 people who provided information that prevented foreign terror attacks or led to the arrests of terror suspects, according to the State Department.

Here are some of the most prominent terror leaders who remain at large:

Ayman al-Zawahiri: $25 million bounty

Zawihiri was Osama bin Laden’s top adviser and assumed the job as leader of al-Qaeda after bin Laden’s death. The U.S. has indicted him in connection with the Aug. 7, 1998, bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya that killed 224 people.

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi: $10 million bounty

Al-Baghdadi is the leader of the Islamic State, a terror group that has taken over large swaths of Iraq and Syria and is quickly expanding its influence throughout the region. Al-Baghdadi got his start as a leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq. The Islamic State, also known by the acronyms ISIS or ISIL, split from al-Qaeda in 2013 and grew rapidly.

Sirajuddin Haqqani: $10 million bounty

Haqqani is the operational head of a militant group operating in Afghanistan that has been responsible for attacks on coalition and Afghan targets, including numerous deadly suicide bombings and kidnappings. The State Department named the Haqqani Network a terrorist organization in 2012.

Hafiz Mohammed Saeed: $10 million bounty

Saeed is a founder of the Pakistani Taliban, which seeks to establish radical Islamist rule over India and Pakistan. “Saeed is suspected of masterminding numerous terrorist attacks, including the 2008 Mumbai attacks, which resulted in the deaths of 166 people, including six American citizens,” according to the State Department.

Yasin al-Suri: $10 million bounty

The U.S. government accuses Suri of being a top al-Qaeda facilitator based in Iran. He has helped facilitate the movement of militants into Syria and Western countries.

So a few days go by and I have the test again, and once again the same enzymes are elevated. Now I’m freaking out looking up everything on doctor google, and have fallen into the pit of health anxiety seeing everything from cancer to liver failure. A week or two goes by, and my doc runs a hepatitis test that comes back negative, and I have the enzyme test once more, and no longer have the AST, or the ALT elevated.. just the bilirubin, and he says I most likely have Gilbert’s syndrome. My only confusion with that is that Gilbert’s syndrome does not elevate the AST, or ALT that I had from the previous test, and those most likely indicate liver damage. I’m not really sure how to approach this, but I am still constantly worried of all of the other options it could be, especially the more deadly ones... pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, liver failure.. etc.. do any of you guys have any knowledge on this subject? This health anxiety is relentless and has me constantly looking for symptoms, even to the point of my mind making them up, and I suddenly feel like I am experiencing them. ",1.0,reddit healthanxiety

Do we completely outlaw vehicles?  Do we bring about prohibition again?   So really, ... where is the outrage over completely needless deaths of loved ones at the hands of impaired drivers - legal or not - on roadways, highways, neighborhood streets DAILY ????  Why are THOSE deaths acceptable that we just keep reporting large numbers of dead as if reading a farm report about crops dying? ...  what seems like ‘the inevitable ‘ in this country should be addressed just as vehemently as gun deaths.  Who is to blame about these figures???  Who has the ultimate responsibility to ‘protect the public’ with passioned rhetoric about “No more DUI deaths!!!”  I just don’t hear it.  It’s all about ‘political advantage and mileage’ in Washington agendas ... and gun control is a highly contested hot potato but to be trotted out hours after a mass shooting calling for tighter gun control behind the national rage from constituents over the senseless killing of innocents by a deranged human.  Firearms vs. automobiles ... which gives political parties more momentum during upcoming elections?
Here are the figures of auto deaths we publish, yet seemingly with all the passion of reading a farm report ... something is wrong in this country when we promote alcohol in countless TV commercials, ... merchandising automobiles in those same venues being the fastest, more powerful than last years models.  We don’t see TV commercials for various types of ammo, ... or the bigger more powerful firearm available to the public for purchase.  But we don’t flinch at the DUI/DWI deaths that occur each year.... do we.  Why not?
IMHO
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 37,133 people died in traffic crashes in 2017 in the United States (latest figures available), including an estimated 10,874 people who were killed in drunk driving crashes involving a driver with an illegal BAC (.08 or greater).

7325," |body| Today's Scripture is from John 8:24





“Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.”--John 8:24. In this verse, Jesus emphasized that the fatal, unforgivable and eternal sin is failure to believe in Him as Messiah and Son of God. In Truth, all other sins can be forgiven if this one is repented of. God says some terrible things about the sins of those who refuse to believe in Jesus. He says they shall die in their sins; that their sins will follow after them; that they have no cloak to cover up their sins; that their sins remain on them.

Much too often we fail to understand God’s standard for sin. We, as believers have a blessed hope whereas the unbeliever doesn’t have hope and his sins will follow him to judgment. For those who don’t follow Christ, heaven will be closed against them and only perdition can await them. Jesus further shows that sin is the alienation of the heart from God. In this passage Jesus voiced conviction that man’s basic trouble, in any age, is sin and that the basic sin is unbelief. These men were perplexed but their perplexity was not brought about by their stupidity or mental limitations. They were blind sinners because their hearts refused to believe.

Jesus forewarned his hearers that He was going away. He predicted that after His departure they would recognize their error and quest for Him, but that opportunity for their repentance would be gone. “Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your sin remains.”--John 9:41. If they knew their lostness and darkness and cried out for spiritual light, they would no longer be guilty of the sin of unbelief in Christ. But satisfied that their darkness was light, and continuing in rejection of Christ, their sin remained.

Today I encourage each of you to take this great work that Christ has empowered us to deliver to the world and deliver it. We cannot allow people that we know and love or those who we don’t know to die in their sins. We need to be bold in our approach but lovingly explaining the Gospel. We should be willing to have them dragged over our dead bodies before we give up on them. Christ didn’t give up on us and we are to imitate Him.

I’m writing this, I suppose, because things seem to be at a point of spiralling now.

I’m having daily panic attacks. Ones where I’m in tears and hyperventilating but also can’t breathe and my heart races so fast. It can be triggered by someone being too close to me on the train, thinking about my future, basically anything. It’s starting to hurt my body a lot. I can’t go to events with my friends for fear of having a panic attack. I get so nauseous I can’t eat. If I don’t see someone and they get to close to me I jump out of my skin and shake for hours after. Sometimes I get so frustrated by this and don’t know what to do I will just hit myself until it stops.

I feel so isolated from everyone, including the few who are close to me.

I go through spirals of very bad thoughts about self harm and they do go away but always come back.

Changes in my routine distress me to a not normal degree.

It’s made me realize I need to speak to somebody about what’s happening and maybe get some help, and I’ve been contacting my local mental health centres and trying to get in touch with therapy centres (local free ones, as I can’t afford a real one and don’t have medical coverage or any benefits). People keep referring me to other people and then people simply don’t get back to me. I do keep trying but it seems so bleak. I have made an appointment to see a medical doctor but I’m afraid he’s just going to prescribe me some random medication and that it will be hard for me to describe what’s going on and thus do something to make all this stop.

(Also, I do yoga, take cbd and ashwaghanda and constantly practice calming activities but it only works for a little while).

The first time happened a week into moving into our new house. A methhead tweaker and her boyfriend came driving down my driveway at two in the morning.

The man had a baseball bat and he was sneaking up my front porch. Wasting know time I pointed my gun at the back of the woman's head and called out to the man on the porch letting him know if he insisted on dying I would be more than happy to send him on his way. While I was covering the two would be douche bags my wife was on the phone with 911. It took law enforcement two hours to get get to my house.

The second time happened in the middle of the day my wife, daughter and I had just got back from the doctors office. We had arrived in time to see our house getting robbed.

6030,"Abuse PTSD Trigger warning: domestic abuse

Hi,

I ended an abusive three-year relationship two years ago. My partner was severely emotionally and psychologically abusive, gaslighting me about an affair for a year, and other mind games and insults that targeted my sense of self-worth and the way I navigate the world (honest communication, reciprocity, social norms, etc.)

After that year I began experiencing the first symptoms—depression, anxiety and dissociation. He escalated to shouting, throwing things around, leaving then returning in the night rifling through things, growling and not responding, he once punched a dresser so hard he broke his hand then said he “couldn’t guarantee my face wouldn’t be next,” his mood would flip on a dime and he would fly into these wild rages...

This all created an extremely stressful and unsafe living environment. My symptoms became more severe, including self-harm, and I was finally diagnosed with PTSD. We broke up, I went to therapy, went on medication, and have been healing for the last two years or so.

After we broke up he moved away, but he still comes back to town to visit. My friends let me know whenever he’s in town so I can be careful to avoid him. The thing is—when we comes back it’s like all the progress I’ve made doesn’t matter. I get panic attacks, depressed and I’ve also dissociated.

I’m writing here to reach other women who have been a similar situation. I’m looking for strategies for managing this when it happens (aside from overloading on anti-anxiety meds, which is my go-to). I would be so grateful to hear your stories—what works, what doesn’t—and maybe just know that I’m not alone. This is a very isolating disease.

I'm scared my schizophrenia, depersonalization/derealization, melancholia, OCD, anxiety, depression, loneliness, too much free time on my hands, ... will soon transform into dementia. I recently volunteered once for Habitat for Humanity, but it was too stressful, not because of the work which I did finish successfully, but because of the social interaction with the people there. It scrambles my brain, gives me dry mouth, shrinks my penis as if the weather outside was freezing, makes me leak urine and need to urinate constantly, I don't know where to place my eyes when people are around which I think is how I got eye floaters, the wondering what people are thinking of me from my being an avoidant mute, the depression and sadness from seeing everyone else being social and lighthearted, intrusive thoughts involving the people around me, ... I was always a loner since I can remember. I had selective mutism in preschool and I would do weird things like stay up and draw at a table when everyone else had to sleep on their mats. I dreaded lunchtime because I had to eat alone. I would hide in the restrooms or library. I had romantic interests, but I could never imagine myself successfully being with those people socially, so I eventually just stuck to porn and masturbating.

I'm lucky my parents paid off the house in which I live with them in, that they own a property that has 3 residences that can be rented out, and that I have a brother who will most likely get a ""real"" job and get married soon. I don't have to worry about financially taking care of my parents because they have retirement and a good health plan.

I help one of my uncles by working under the table at his swap meet selling Latin American home remedy products to mostly 1st-generation Spanish-speaking immigrants.

Plane crashes into Potomac


On this day in 1982, an Air Florida Boeing 727 plunges into the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., killing 78 people. The crash, caused by bad weather, took place only two miles from the White House.

The Air Florida flight took off from Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, with 74 passengers and 5 crew members on board. The plane had flown into Washington from Miami in the early afternoon and was supposed to return to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, after a short stop. However, snow in Washington temporarily closed the airport. When it reopened, the plane was de-iced with chemical anti-freeze, but the plane still had difficulty moving away from the gate due to the ice. When it eventually made it to the airport’s only usable runway, it was forced to wait 45 minutes for clearance to take off.

Not wanting to further delay the flight, the pilot, Larry Wheaton, did not return for more de-icing, and worse, failed to turn on the plane’s own de-icing system. In fact, the pilot and co-pilot discussed the situation, and the co-pilot said “It’s a losing battle trying to de-ice these things. It gives you a false sense of security, that’s all it does.” During the delay, however, ice was accumulating on the wings, and by the time the plane reached the end of the runway, it was able to achieve only a few hundred feet of altitude.

Thirty seconds later, the plane crashed into the 14th Street Bridge over the Potomac River, less than a mile away from the runway. Seven vehicles traveling on the bridge were struck by the 727 and the plane fell into the freezing water. It was later determined that 73 of the people on board the plane died from the impact, leaving only six survivors in the river. In addition, four motorists died in the crash.

Terrible traffic in Washington that day made it difficult for rescue workers to reach the scene. Witnesses didn’t know what to do to assist the survivors who were stuck in the freezing river. Finally, a police helicopter arrived and began assisting the survivors in a very risky operation.

Two people in particular emerged as heroes during the rescue: Arland Williams and Lenny Skutnik. Known as the “sixth passenger,” Williams survived the crash, and passed lifelines on to others rather than take one for himself. He ended up being the only plane passenger to die from drowning. When one of the survivors to whom Williams had passed a lifeline was unable to hold on to it, Skutnik, who was watching the unfolding tragedy, jumped into the water and swam to rescue her. Both Skutnik and Williams (along with bystander Roger Olian) received the Coast Guard Gold Lifesaving Medal. The bridge was later renamed the Arland D. Williams Jr. Memorial Bridge.

I was really suffering, because she has her problems too and when I try to talk with her about it she doesn't respond well. I tried do keep my distance, try to get over it, but she likes me a lot and we became even closer.
Relationships are a huge problem for me, and my friend is in a different phase of life. She broke with her first boyfriend recently (they were together from age 13 till 18, church boyfriend, holding hands only, she was unhappy) and now she is dating a lot of guys no strings attached, a lot like what I do, but it hurts for me to see it. I started avoiding being at the same places she goes to and the others close to me are telling me she is not really all that.  So I decided to put our friendship on a hold too, since I'm unhappy with this ""let's speed date everyone we can and maybe we'll get together at the end"". I can't keep having sex and making out with strangers to compensate her actions, you know? It became toxic. Yesterday we've had a huge fight about it, because I told her I didn't like to be exposed this way.
Edit 1: She thought I called her a whore idk but things went ugly and she told me that I was the one she liked.

The intent of the 2nd Amendment is to prepare Americans for war against any tyrannical government --- to exercise the Right of Revolution.

Toward that perfectly legitimate end, Americans must have weapons and ammo of the same quality --- or better quality --- than their taxes provided to the government itself.

After all, we are under no obligation whatever to arm a government against ourselves --- with our own money --- and then permit those same gangsters to deny us the right to obtain the same or better weapons --- with our own money.

595,"I think my psych is taking advantage of EMDR sessions. I don't know what to do. It took me YEARS to even make the call to find a therapist thanks to my depression. I started approximately in September. For several weeks we just talked about current issues to establish rapport and I was actually feeling pretty good. She sent me home with a packet explaining EMDR but said she does ""timelines"" rather than events, where we went through different ages of my life and what events stood out to me from those ages.

We were set to begin actual EMDR in November but then I got into a major car wreck with my small child in the car (we walked away, somehow), so dealing with the PTSD from that came first. She had me process the wreck using EMDR. She uses vibrating paddles, if it matters. She never really had me describe the wreck to her, just what I was noticing and how my body was feeling as I played it back in my head. It was a great success; in one session I went from not being able to close my eyes without feeling the car rolling, to at least being able to sleep.

Due to holidays, work, etc we didn't actually start EMDR until a couple of weeks ago. During the session she turns the paddle control board so that I can't see her. She has me go through my workspace and safe space routine, then reminds me of the events we wrote on my timeline for whatever we're focusing on. She tells me to visualize the events as if I'm watching a movie but she never asks me about them.

Then she dicks around on her phone or reads a book on her kindle while I hold what amounts to two vibrators, and occasionally asks what I'm noticing in my body. Based on what I read here, she's really not doing this right, but she's an MD and I've also been EXTREMELY vulnerable to her so I don't know what the fuck to do.

Africa Study Bible Notes
Freedom from Deception

A traditional Kikuyu story from Kenya tells how, long ago, some girls fell into trouble with an ogre. He had disguised himself to look like a handsome man so that he could trap a woman to eat. One day as the girls were walking and singing, the ogre jumped before them. One of the girls was shocked to see a mouth at the back. Realising what he was, she ran away. The same thing happened again with each girl running away until only one girl was left. When the ogre jumped, she too saw the mouth at the back, but she decided to continue following him anyway.

They reached his home and after some time passed, other people told her that he was really an ogre. Coming to her senses, she decided to return home. As she started her journey, she sang a song, and her brother responded with a refrain about how he had known all along that the young man was an ogre. When the ogre realised that his tasty human meal was gone, he chased the girl. The brother met his sister as she approached her home and killed the ogre. Having learned her lesson, the girl decided never to follow strangers again.

This story illustrates that there are many deceivers in the world. It also shows that it may not be easy to identify deceivers, but once we do, we need to protect ourselves against them. People may flatter us only to do us harm. Even Christian leaders deceive people to gain wealth. The Holy Spirit’s wisdom helps us to identify deceivers. The psalmist cries out in distress, “Rescue me, O Lord, from liars and from all deceitful people.” Pray like the psalmist for God to rescue you from liars. Make sure that you are honest and trustworthy so that other people do not pray this prayer about you!",0.0,rallypoint first500

9019,"Fears of ALS or other Motor Neuron Disease. Please help! M. 27 years. Type Two Diabetic - diet and medication controlled. History of chronic back pain, around T6-T7 vertebrae, unilateral up until a few months ago, now bilateral.

For a few weeks I've had a light flickering that alternates in each eye. This is accompanied with occasional twitching, particularly in my right tricep, forearm and occasionally my hand. These occur any where between once and three to four times a day, and while strong are often brief.

I am pretty sure that the symptoms started after a pulled muscle in the right side of my neck. I had some stiffness for a few hours one morning, before I turned my head suddenly, causing a shooting pain up that side of my neck and within a short time, a massive headache, (lasting about a day) followed by an inability to move my head properly for a few days.

Smaller twitches occur up and down my legs, though I feel that may have to do with acute sensitivity due to how much anxiety this is causing me. And I have had a lot of lower back, hip and left leg pain that has come and gone for the last five or so years.

Other symptoms that occur include pain and weakness in my pinky, shoulder and inner forearm that come and go. These symptoms are exacerbated when I am seated, at work and are particularly intense when I am at work, using a mouse, keyboard, or when my arm is crooked at an awkward angle for too long, such as using my phone.

Logic tells me that all of this is caused by a combination environmental factors and anxiety, given that about 8 months ago, I made the transition from a standing job (various retail positions for about 8 years), to a desk job, and I've NEVER had great posture.

My physio is confident that all of this is caused by compression of the Cervical spine, where he says there is obvious stiffness between the joints in some parts, particularly at the base of the skull. He also says the spindle especially likes to compensate, so pain in one area untreated can eventually lead to difficulties along the whole spine, and that after ten years of untreated pain, he isnt surprised by my symptoms. He and my GP suggest seeing a neurologist, but only if my symptoms persist.

Sorry for the long post. This has really allowed me to catalogue and rationalise my thoughts. In all honesty, I am feeling as though this may be anxiety. An abnormal ultrasound showed possible cancer of the testicle this time last year, and I've been spiraling ever since...

I have metatarsal fat pad atrophy; that's when the fat that pads the ball of your foot magically disappears and you are walking on bone. Causes extreme pain and bone fatigue, and can lead to stress fractures and arthritis (which it did to my big toe before it was finaly caught). It took over six. Whole. Years.

I was called out in formation because of it, SNCOs would belittle me in front of other NCOs for it, etc.
On top of that, I deployed while I had this condition and had no problems out there (the pain was there, but a big ol' Motrin usually did the trick). So in all, it never really interfered with my actual job.
I dreaded reporting to work every day. There was one particular E-7 that I avoided at all costs; he wasn't just harsh, he would attack my family, my wife, etc. because of it. He once told me to never reproduce in front of a group of NCOs because of it. My supervisor was no help; I told him I was actually having suicidal thoughts because of it, and his response? ""You need to stop being so timid."" I was an E-4 getting put on blast by an E-7 in front of a group of E-5s and E-6s simply because I was on a profile; I would respond professionally, but it sort of glanced off with no real consideration. And I'm not gonna tell an SNCO in front of a bunch of NCOs to eff off. I got lucky, to be honest; that E-7 retired not long after, and most people eventually forgot about it. But I didn't. I actively avoided medical treatment for a while thanks to that. That eventually led to a PT test failure, which of course led to a slew of other issues.

I’m 19 (F). I’m quite fit, always busy and have hobbies that keep me physically and mentally stimulated and this sincerely helps me and my battle with anxiety for nearly 6 years now. For this year, I began having pains on the left side of my chest. I had never experienced anything like it before, not ever during when I felt gushes of anxiety or even during panic attacks, but it began to get more frequent and seemed to correlate with my anxiety levels.

I believed at first it was heart palpitations, as this is something I usually get minus the pain but ignored it. It began to get worse one night to a point where I honestly felt like I was going into a cardiac arrest. It felt like my heart was being squeezed and I felt so much pressure around my chest, as if it was going to burst. I literally cried for hours because of the pain. I cannot compare it to anything else, it was incredibly painful beyond words.

I went to a GP and even A&amp;E because the pain got so bad. Everything was okay, tests came back fine and they said that it was my anxiety causing it, as I suffer from very bad anxiety and have been for years now. They just sent me away, increased my dosage of medication not long after and everything seemed fine.

It came back tonight after months of disappearing, and it was when I was only experiencing mild anxiety. Now I’m bed ridden with pain and terrified once again.

I don’t know if anyone else gets this who experiences anxiety. I really need reassurance or advice, for I don’t know what is going on and if this is truly anxiety related or could be something else. I’m so panicked and afraid to go to another medical professional if I’m making something out of nothing. I just need a virtual hug that someone could help me with this.

4947,"Not diagnosed with anything. Just made a connection with a childhood trauma and intense anxiety, and wondering if it could be the cause. Any input welcome! Hi there!
I’ll get right to it. As a toddler I witnessed one of my parents die suddenly, and I saw the reaction of the other parent and the paramedics responding to the scene. This is my very first memory, after which I have absolutely no memories for a couple years. Nothing about having the event explained to me, staying with grandparents, the funeral. Nothing. I have that one memory then flash forward a few years to normalcy with no-one really talking about what happened. Growing up I was aware of this memory but didn’t view it as good or bad, it was just what happened. However I grew into a fairly anxious child/teen - often worrying about my family and in particular about health problems. Bit of a hypochondriac! Went to therapy as a teen for anxiety, and have just been referred again now in my twenties. At the appointment where I got referred, my doctor asked if anything traumatic had happened to someone close to me before. This question was asked to me 6 months previously at another appointment, and I said no. But this time I said, well I saw one of my parents pass suddenly, and she seemed to think this connected a lot of things. Looking back, I kind of agree - the first time I went to therapy, my anxiety attacks began exactly the day after I saw someone else collapse, just like what I saw as a child. I never drew a parallel until recently. I was also a clingy child, very clingy to my family and my friends, even to this day. I don’t really know what my point is here, I know nothing about trauma or how it can affect people but I feel like I’ve just discovered the root of most of my anxiety. Any input from others in a similar situation, or any advice in general, would be more than welcome! ",1.0,reddit ptsd

908,"Thoughts on how to help a friend who believes he’s a targeted individual? Hi all,

I hope it’s okay I’m posting here. I have a dear friend who has become totally invested in the concept of gang stalking. For almost a year now he constantly talkings about “them” and how he’s followed everywhere he goes and harassed daily. He won’t order takeout for fear of them messing with his food. He spent several months out of work cooped up in his home to avoid the harassment. He’s back at work now, but he still believes they’re targeting him.

I’ve tried everything in my power to help him but he refuses. I’ve tried to bring him to the hospital, I’ve sent mental health agencies to his home, and I’ve scheduled therapy appointments for him. He refuses all help. He becomes angry and defensive  if I tell him maybe this all isn’t happening.  (It’s never my intention to upset him, I just don’t know how to respond to his beliefs.)
Another problem is that part of the whole conspiracy is that “they” do things subtly to make it mimic mental illness in the individual, so when he’s met with doubt he justifies the claim by saying “it’s like that on purpose so that no one will believe me.”

There have been other beliefs he’s expressed (his neighbors are spies/ actors for the government, helicopters circle his home, his belongings have been tampered with,) that also come across as delusional.

It’s all very worrisome and I’m scared it’s only going to get worse. My question here is have any of you experienced these beliefs (gang stalking) in yourself or someone else? How do you respond when you think someone is delusional?

Aside from continuing to encourage professional help, is there anything else I can do to try and steer him in the right direction? I want to help him so badly.

So I don't have a general idea about how everyone feels to their each own schizophrenia in this sub, but I felt spontaneous  about sharing my thoughts\^\^


 I'll try summarize this. So I've dealt with schizophrenia, OCD, PTSD (tho im not fond of lightly saying that only cause i know someone who has it worse), and intrusive thoughts for as long as I can remember. Ever since I was a kid I'd tell people ""oh that wasn't my idea, that was my from my other minds"" or something similar to that extent in what I was feeling or my ever changing moods. I never saw it as odd but with the mix of intrusive thoughts after lots and lots of traumatic events in my life, it became the norm in a sense of getting used to the terrible things my other minds were saying (12 in total).
 Actually 2/3 siblings also have a form of multiple minds, but to them- without intrusive thoughts, which have usually helped them academically at faster paces or help when it came to inventing things or new ideas. I hated it actually for a long period of time. And each year that went on I felt as I was mentally losing my mind, wanting to claw my eyes out to stop the constant battering &amp; deterioration of my mind. These would usually go on during times of hard depression. That all changed tho when a good friend of mine &amp; close friend of my gf at the time, committed suicide. November 2017.


 All of my other minds that day when silent, and it was one of the scariest things of my life. After getting over his death, almost an entire year of bad events followed. I felt more alone losing my minds than the friendships and hardships that year. My minds would only come and talk to me during times it felt like the worst or times after I'd lose my mind again in an uncontrollable rage from terrible arguments among other people. But be there to comfort me &amp; remain for a few days before disappearing again. My minds became my only source of comfort.


 After that I guess I sought out reasons or ways it benefited me to have schizophrenia. If my minds ever left me completely, what would I be without them? It's a part of me that's been around so long. And if I learned to control it or grow more compatible with them, wouldn't they benefit me like they do my siblings? Imagine the brain power of 12 different minds working on 1 problem or idea. In all honesty I really wish I had more to say on this last part, I'd say my minds have notice how hard it's been on me with work. I guess they've stayed quiet to help me focus and figure out life, but I know they're still there. I actually really miss them.

Usually, I avoid brick &amp; mortar stores like the plague, especially those that have tiny spaces with staff in them who do not currently have any shelves to fill, so they just stand there and wait for potential customers to annoy. I hate having to talk to them, so I buy most everything online. But today, I thought I would force such a situation and maybe even make this a regular practice. So I stood in front of the store, then I moved away for fear of making people inside wonder why it's taking me so long to come in, then I moved past the store again, and then I definitely could not go in because at that point I had passed there twice, so surely everyone must assume I'm some sort of weirdo who can't make up his mind about what he wants.

And what if I had gone through with it? I would not have been able to express my thoughts clearly and coherently, I would have tripped over my tongue trying to form sentences, I would have been caught off guard by sales peoples' questions, and in the end I would have bought something I didn't even want just to have a reason to escape the situation. Utterly pointless.

I know I should do it anyway, and I know I should do such things often, but I just don't. If I can't make myself do it, how could others do it? What is there to gain from seeking professional help?

The real goal is to be able to talk to girls btw, but hey. I am light years away from that.

A couple days ago I was on reddit and I was on a big subreddit with 400k+ members. And I saw one of the biggest posts on the subreddit, and it was uploaded about 90 days ago. So I thought it was a good idea to report it to the mods, and I did and they said they removed it, but it’s still viewable by a link.I’m scared that if he reports it to the police they’ll wonder how i found it and they’ll investigate me. But before I did it I messaged the mod and he said they don’t report people To the police. I didn’t even post it, I just stumbled upon it and I reported it. The video had 1 million views on gfycat, and 6k upvotes on reddit.And they’ll get a search warrant for me and my life will be ruined, I’m scared because i got nudes one year ago, but they’ve been deleted for a year, but law enforcement can still find  it, and they’ll count it as possession.

5776,"Getting Married in 2 days &amp; suffering with reactive depression: advice needed please. Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start by sharing my story:

I am 22 years old and in 2 days I am marrying my best friend who is also the love of my life (we have been together for 8 years). I have been diagnosed with reactive depression and I'm going through a pretty tough time right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been seeing a therapist and she is very helpful. We have discussed what I believe caused my depression:

I. Last year **my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer**. She battled it and won but I never really processed her illness. For around 5-6 months I shut myself off emotionally.

II. For the past 2 years I have **battled asthma**, trying to improve my lung capacity so that I could join the armed forces which has always been my dream since I was very little. My father, grandfather, great grandfather etc were all soldiers and it had always been something I wanted to do. My asthma was getting worse but I tried to ignore (which was extremely stressful) it until I ended up in hospital and going back on inhalers which meant any aspirations of joining the army were over. This really crushed me.

III. I left university with an **engineering degree** and started working at a job I hated. I only worked there because I was engaged and felt the need to start saving up money for when I was married. This was a really stressful experience as the job was making my asthma worse.

IV. I grew up in an **impoverished area** and my family never had a lot of money. Throughout school I worked very hard putting myself under a lot of pressure to do well so I could escape my background. I only did an engineering degree because I thought I would make lots of money and get out of my poor area and then become happy as a result. I never enjoyed my degree and it was extremely hard.

V. I have a lot **childhood trauma** from when I was 6-7 years old. My dad's uncle was tragically killed by two drunk drivers and my dad became very depressed. He would drink a lot and cause a lot of disturbance at home at night. This would really scare me and my way of escaping it was trying to sleep. Nowadays when I'm faced with a situation where I cant get to sleep it really makes anxious.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially in the past 2-3 years I have lived my life in a pressure cooker so to speak. I have put myself under immense stress and about 8 weeks ago I had a breakdown. Myself and my fiancé were staying at a hotel, I began to have a massive panic attack and we had to leave the hotel and go home. Since then I have felt extremely low and very anxious over the smallest things. The idea of my wedding makes me terrified. The idea of moving out of my home also scares me. I feel like life is moving faster than I'm ready for and I just want my mental health to improve.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no appetite, I find it hard to relax, I've stopped socialising and I've lost enjoyment in nearly all aspects of life.

Can anyone give me any advice on **how I can start putting my life together again?** I love my partner and I want to be a good husband to her. I feel like I am a burden on her right now and I don't want to go into my marriage depressed and anxious all the time. Cheers guys.

He is the best friend I can ask for and a brother at arms now matter of fact but I guess he knew that I had gone through some rough times. It was after that which made me realize that I needed help.  I think I am still working through a lot of those traumas even if its been over a decade.  I know there are people out there that need the help but are afraid one way or another, I was one of them.

Do you think tighter security will be the future for events such as these? |body| I love attending events such as these, however, because of the many ""weapon like props"" for the many costumed themes associated with these events, do you think that tighter security screens and/or ""Gun Free Zones"" should be enforced as part of security for events like ""ZombiCon"" or the more famous ""ComiCon""? Do you think more security measures should have been in place, and may have prevented this from happening? What are your thoughts?

""One person died and four others were hurt after shooting broke out at a zombie-themed event in Florida Saturday, authorities said.
The shooting happened at about 11:44 p.m. in downtown Fort Myers at a ""ZombiCon"" event, Fort Myers police said.
""I heard four gunshots and saw the crowd 10 feet in front of me part, and everyone turn and start running,"" Desere Lee, a student at Florida Gulf State University who was at the event, told NBC News.
Five people in all were shot, and a male died at the scene, police said. The dead man was identified as Expavious Tyrell Taylor, according to a statement by Fort Myers Mayor Randy Henderson.
""We pray for all involved in this senseless act of violence,"" the statement said. ""With the aid of alert citizens and cameras we remain confident in capturing and bringing to justice, those who have attacked our citizens.""
Four of the surviving victims were brought to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries and another person who was hurt refused medical attention at the scene, authorities said.
A suspect is still at large, according to police.
The organizers of the event, billed as ""the largest gathering of zombies and those who love them in the state of Florida"" said they were ""deeply saddened"" by the violence. The annual festival had been expected to draw more than 20,000 fans in costume.
ZombiCon is a charity event where participants dress up as zombies. It wasn't clear if the shooting involved participants of the event, but organizers said it occurred ""within the footprint"" of ZombiCon.
""We take the safety of our patrons very seriously and take precautions in hiring security and police officers for our annual event,"" the organizers, Pushing DaiZies, Inc., said in a statement posted to Facebook. ""Our prayers go out to the family members and individuals involved in the incident.""
ZombiCon has been a popular event for nearly a decade, but some local residents and business owners have not welcomed the crowd of costumed revelers in the street dressed as limping, bloated, degrading corpses.
One restaurant posted signs warning visitors that ZombiCon participants were not welcome.
""Quarantined. No Zombies allowed,"" the signs read.

That problem was miniscule compared to this one night I had. I don't remember when exactly it was but I remember it was during 9th grade summer break.

7433,"Is Wellbutrin the devil? Hi everyone. This is my first Reddit post so bear with me. I was recently diagnosed with anxiety and moderate depressive disorder. My doctor had a plan to put me on Lexapro and Wellbutrin but said that I had to start the Lexapro (10 mg) and take it alone for a month before adding the Wellbutrin. My life has been CHANGED by the Lexapro. I’m happy and hardly ever anxious and have had hardly any suicidal ideation.  I went for my one month follow up yesterday and was prescribed my Wellbutrin. (150 mg) My doctor warned me that a lot of people get MORE anxious and jittery for the first few weeks and that the medication lowers the seizure threshold. These side effects don’t sit well with me and I almost wonder if it’s worth it to start if the Lexapro alone has helped so much.

After severe daily panic attacks multiple times a day over the summer, specifically regarding things going on with my body, and going to the ER because of it, I finally went to seek help for my anxiety in general. I scheduled an appointment with my GP, who was very supportive (started me off with 25 mg Zoloft and referred me to mental health services within the clinic), and subsequently with a psychologist (I see them every week) and psychiatrist (who I agreed with to up my dose to 50 mg which just started recently, so we'll see how that goes, I'm just nervous about antidepressants in general I guess).

Over a period of about two months, I haven't had any negative thoughts about my health. Well, at least in regards to ""oh my god am I having a stroke/heart attack/aneurysm right now am I gonna die"", like I don't think I'm in any mortal danger. But then, after a period of depersonalization/derealization, I began questioning reality, existence, how things began in general, how life and consciousness is even possible, who I am -- basically just a huge existential crisis.

8625,"11 JAN--This Day in US Military History |body| 1944 – Franz Kettner, a private in the German army and a prisoner of war at Camp Hearne in Texas, is killed by a Nazi kangaroo court.

Internment camps for German prisoners of war were dominated by Nazi enforcers, who killed as many as 150 of their fellow prisoners during World War II. Only seven were officially considered murder.
Kettner’s wrists were slashed so that his death would be recorded as a suicide. Even the smallest infraction could put German prisoners at risk. Those who talked to guards, spoke English, or refused to parrot the Nazi line were often beaten or killed. American camp officials generally looked the other way because they appreciated the discipline and order that the Nazis provided in the camps.
Prisoners who were not ethnically German and had been conscripted into service were particularly in danger from their fellow prisoners. In the later part of 1943, a rash of murders were committed at camps all across America. When Corporal Johann Kunze was beaten to death in an Oklahoma camp for allegedly providing Americans with information, five Nazi sergeants were charged with his murder. They were hanged in 1945 and became the first foreign prisoners of war to meet that fate in the United States.
Hans Geller, a prisoner in Arkansas, was killed by his fellow soldiers despite a stellar war record as a paratrooper for the German army. His only mistake was his fluency in English.
Eventually, American officials began separating the Nazis from the anti-Nazi Germans, and three camps were set aside for those who opposed Hitler. Despite Nazi threats that those who opposed them would be in bad shape when the war was over, anti-Nazi prisoners were often put in positions of power by Americans when they were repatriated. The Nazis, on the other hand, were widely scorned after Hitler’s defeat.

Death Before Sin?
“For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” (1 Corinthians 15:21-22)

Modern evangelicals have found it fashionable to accommodate Scripture to the concept of a very old earth. These views all do serious harm to Scripture, including the current compromise of choice, the “framework hypothesis,” which holds that the passages that seem to deal with science and early history contain only “spiritual” truth but not factual content. Each such attempt to accept vast ages before the appearance of man has many flaws, but perhaps the most damaging to the Christian faith is the problem of death before sin.

The Bible plainly teaches that “the wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23). Before Adam and Eve rebelled, animals ate only plants (Genesis 1:30). Death came as a result of sin and the curse: “For in the day that thou eatest thereof [the forbidden tree] thou shalt surely die” (Genesis 2:17). The first death in all of creation occurred when God provided Adam and Eve animal skins for clothing. Sin always brings death. “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned” (Romans 5:12). Indeed, “the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now” (Romans 8:22). That this is not referring to spiritual death only is clear from today’s verse, which deals with physical resurrection from the dead. Just as Adam’s sin brought death on all creation, so Christ’s resurrection brings victory over death.

But here is the problem. If death existed before Adam, then death is not the penalty for sin. How, then, did Christ’s death pay the penalty for our sin? If death is not tied to Adam’s sin, then life is not tied to Christ’s death and resurrection, and the Christian faith is all in vain.

7149,"Back in 1970. I didn't know what PTSD was.  I just thought I was ""losing it"" when sudden rage came over me over a few not-too-big-a-deal situations back in the world (for example, a woman honking her car horn at me while I was driving, I erupted in curses and shaking my fist).  A fellow employee in my car looked at me like I was weird and (of course) I was embarrassed.  What could I say?

So...not knowing what ""it"" was for over ten years and then discovering (something shown about PTSD on TV) that I wasn't alone.  Others were dealing with the aftermath of traumatic events (for me, it was Vietnam experiences in forward artillery base camps).  What a relief!  I wasn't ""losing it.""

I didn't tell anyone, not even my kids while they were growing up.  I could handle it pretty well, by then.  I did tell a couple of really close, supportive friends and my wife.

Lately, I've included my siblings.

After those first ten years, the rage gradually subsided or I recognized the triggers and avoided bad situations (especially the sound of helicopters and explosions and smell of gun smoke/cordite/powder on the 4th of July).

The nightmares still continue (much less frequently), and I no longer have nightmares about being in Vietnam.  My nightmares are of other ""dangers"" such as vicious dogs, wolves, wild cats, bears, bad people, etc.  For that change alone, I am grateful.

The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre


Fourmen dressed as police officers enter gangster Bugs Moran’s headquarters on North Clark Street in Chicago, line seven of Moran’s henchmen against a wall, and shoot them to death. The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre, as it is now called, was the culmination of a gang war between arch rivals Al Capone and Bugs Moran.

George “Bugs” Moran was a career criminal who ran the North Side gang in Chicago during the bootlegging era of the 1920s. He fought bitterly with “Scarface” Al Capone for control of smuggling and trafficking operations in the Windy City. Throughout the 1920s, both survived several attempted murders. On one notorious occasion, Moran and his associates drovesix cars past a hotel in Cicero, Illionis, where Capone and his associates were having lunch and showered the building with more than 1,000 bullets.

A $50,000 bounty on Capone’s head was the final straw for the gangster. He ordered that Moran’s gang be destroyed. On February 14, a delivery of bootleg whiskey was expected at Moran’s headquarters. But Moran was late and happened to see police officers entering his establishment. Moran waited outside, thinking that his gunmen inside were being arrested in a raid. However, the disguised assassins were actually killing the seven men inside.

The murdered men included Moran’s best killers, Frank and Pete Gusenberg. Reportedly Frank was still alive when real officers appeared on the scene. When asked who had shot him, the mortally wounded Gusenberg kept his code of silence, responding, “No one, nobody shot me.”

The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre actually proved to be the last confrontation for both Capone and Moran. Capone was jailed in 1931 and Moran lost so many important men that he could no longer control his territory. On the seventh anniversary of the massacre, Jack McGurn, one of the Valentine’s Day hit men,was killed him in a crowded bowling alley with a burst of machine-gun fire.

McGurn’s killer remains unidentified, but was likely Moran, though hewas never charged with the murder. Moran was relegated to small-time robberies until he was sent to jail in 1946. He died in Leavenworth Federal Prison in 1957 of lung cancer.",0.0,rallypoint first500

Fiancé went through issues that triggered his anxiety and on top of all of that I’m working on healing from my trauma and all the spin offs from it (I’m a assault survivor and the anniversary just happened).  I’m going through some of the darker parts of what happened in therapy and it’s draining on me.

Also add that my mom leans on me for support and I had to talk her down from anxiety in relation to my dad while trying to deal with my own pain and emotions from it.

Rough month right?

I finally hit a wall, I just needed a break.  I had to be strong with all that was going on and it hit me hard.  And yesterday I felt that straw break.

In the middle of all the craziness that was happening at work yesterday, my mom calls me...my step grandmother has cancer (bone) and I just couldn’t. I didn’t want to hear it at that time.  I had shut down.

I couldn’t provide the logic my mom wanted to hear. She didn’t even listen to me when I asked her to stop. She just kept going on and on about what cancer it was and what may happen next and how everyone is upset.  I actually snapped and yelled stop. I told her I could not process right now and that I need a break. I asked to let me had the night and we can talk about it the next day.

Her response was to tell me that “I could just find out about it myself” and hung up on me.

You know, there are a million reasons “why” someone would be attracted to the same sex. There are some LGB people I know who knew they liked the same sex when they were in elementary school. Others who found out later on well past puberty.

Sexual trauma could influence any aspect of life so I don’t doubt that it could have an impact here, but I also don’t think sexual trauma turns people gay alone. I believe there has to be something underlying that the trauma then brings up and affects our ability to repress thoughts or increase the need to come out. Sexual assault can be one of the most embarrassing things a person can experience so the fear associated with coming out as LGB is drastically diminished after such an assault.

To be completely transparent, I don’t consider myself gay or lesbian. While I’m trans, nothing about what I’ve done I consider sexual. What I’ve done has impacted my future sex life, but that is completely collateral to the dysphoria I was experiencing and treating.

As far as this being a natural way to end genetic lines, that really doesn’t seem plausible to me. If that were the case, we would have a direct link to everyone in that family. A parent who came out after having kids would pass along something to those kids in effect making them gay. The evidence just doesn’t really support this from what I’ve seen.

What it comes down to is that between LGB and the T, there are two very distinct issues at play here. We have outward attraction verses inward feeling. I believe 100% that being trans is biological and the science will prove this a few years down the road. Attraction though is something that develops over time and it is something that can drastically change. That shows there is external influence and learning happening that causes our opinions to change on what we find attractive just as we enjoy and dislike certain foods.

There are about a million rabbit holes to go down on this one but those are my initial thoughts.",0.0,rallypoint nock2000

I have been taking lexapro for three years, b/c previous therapists diagnosed anxiety disorder.

I am a mom and wife, and my family loves me. So I really hesitate to medicate. But I also wonder if I should keep taking Lexapro? My therapist said withdrawl from that is ugly, so she doesn't recommend it. But maybe it's been triggering my mania?

Trial begins in Amityville murders


Ronald DeFeo Jr. goes on trial for the killings of his parents and four siblings in their Amityville, New York, home on October 14, 1975. The family’s house was later said to be haunted and served as the inspiration for the Amityville Horror book and movies.

On the evening of November 13, 1974, Ronald “Butch” DeFeo Jr. entered an Amityville bar and told people his parents had been shot inside their home. Several bar patrons accompanied DeFeo back to his family’s home, at 112 Ocean Avenue, where a man named Joe Yeswit called Suffolk Country police to report the crime. When officers arrived, they found the bodies of Ronald DeFeo Sr., age 43, his wife Louise, 42, and their children Dawn, 18, Allison, 13, Marc, 11, and John, 9. The victims had been shot dead in their beds. Ronald DeFeo Jr., 22, initially tried to say the murders were a mob hit; however, by the next day he confessed to committing the crimes himself.

One aspect of the case that puzzled investigators was the fact that all six victims appeared to have died in their sleep, without struggle, and neighbors didn’t hear any gunshots, despite the fact that the rifle DeFeo used didn’t have a silencer. When DeFeo’s trial began in October 1975, his attorney argued for an insanity defense; however, that November, he was found guilty of six counts of second-degree murder and later sentenced to six consecutive sentences of 25 years to life in prison. DeFeo, who gave conflicting accounts of his story over the years, later claimed his sister Dawn and two other accomplices were involved in the murders.

The DeFeo house was sold to George Lutz, who moved in with his wife and three children in December 1975. The new owners resided in the house for 28 days, before they fled, claiming it was haunted by the spirits of the DeFeo family. Critics accused George Lutz of concocting the story to make money, but he maintained he was telling the truth. In 1977, Jay Anson published a novel titled The Amityville Horror. The book became a best-seller and inspired a 1979 movie of the same name, as well as a 2005 remake.",0.0,rallypoint first500

7452,"Most of you need MAOIs and not another SSRI or more therapy Hi,

I suffer from social anxiety and depression. I can just describe my depressive symptons as ""mental exaustion"" everything that I did was a chore and I slowly starded not having the ""energy"" to do things I enjoy, like working out and reading books, at my lowest I had a difficult time even keeping a basic routine, even showering daily was too much for me, I was always late to apointments, always ""tired"". I always thought that I was lazy and that I need just to try harder, but early this year, after trying all the self help stuff for my SA and failing as usual, I finally decided that I need meds to estabilize it so I can start therapy. I already tried fluoxetine before, but it did nothing for my SA or depression, so I contacted my old psy doc and said that I wante to get back on SSRIs. I tried sertraline first, it made me suicidal and more depressed. Then, after 3-4, I switched to pristiq, which also made me feel bad and more depressed, then the doc put me on mirtazapine (a tricyclic) and after 2 days of feeling like a zombie in dream like state (mirtazapine is a powerful anti histaminic, but you get used to it), I found myself able to do shit instead of just staying in bed! Holy shit, I thought, so this is what is like to be normal? I just go with the flow, tasks are done in time and I can have a routine now. I went from browsering youtube all day to working out 3 times a week, heavy weight (started Starting Strength program again), going back to my classes (which I gave up because of ""tiredness"" and SA), eating health. Now, I had luck with a tricyclic , but throught my research I realised that most people with severe depression need meds, and not any kind of meds but MAOIs. I see dozens of posts of people that are years trying every SSRI available and their stupid psy docs don't even prescribe a tricyclic AD and when they tell family and friends they say that they need therapy. Well, I will say the truth here, therapy and self help doesn't do shit for depressed people because they don't have the motivation to do it in the first place, I'm not saying it doesn't help but if all you can do is stay in bed all day it will fail, you beed drugs to help you so you can do the therapy later. So, if anyone in the same situation is reading, please listen to me, don't let your doc try 10 different SSRIs because you are wasting your time, people always cite the study that ""proves"" SSRIs are no more effective than therapy, now this is true, but the problem lies in the SSRIs as a drug class, not on medication as a hole, some people get lucky with it but most don't. If you tried more than 5 SSRIs and SNRIs, try tricyclics, if it doesn't help you absolutely need MAOIs, if you tried everything else and your pdoc doesn't want to prescribe MAOIs, buy it online and found another pdoc to supervise you after you start taking it, just lay the cards on the table, don't let depression waste any more minute of your life because of stupid doctors. Docs don't like MAOIs because they are afraid of the side effects, but today just a basic diet must be followed and you have to stay away from certain drugs and meds, and MAOIs usually have less side effects than SSRIs for most people after the first months, another reason why it is so stupid to not be used.

And yet this morning I laid in bed thinking I could just check out and avoid feeling so damned low all the time (but it would kill my family so it isn't an option).

My wife took early retirement and we moved to the mountains a little earlier than I would have liked. I had a decent job and we could have saved a lot more if I worked for a year or two longer. Money is a big factor in my unhappiness now. I live 1000s of miles away from the country I left to be with her, and we haven't been back in years. I miss my home terribly, despite the scenery around here. My relationship with my family has changed for the better in the time I've been away, but I haven't seen them in years either.

I thought that being able to follow a more creative career path would be perfect for me. I thought I'd love being able to wander the mountains all day. I did love all of that for a while, but now I'm bored and lonely. I miss having mental puzzles to solve in my work. I miss everything about a normal town. I miss getting paid regularly! I didn't realize just how much I needed a job that uses my brain. It wasn't just for the money. I see that now. A good job gives structure and purpose.

My wife is emotionally abusive. I don't think she realizes, but that doesn't change the way she behaves now. I've tried to tell her my concerns about the jobs, money, location, direction etc, but she's not interested in listening. She no longer wants to travel, especially overseas.

I got what I thought would be a dream, but it hasn't worked out that way. The beautiful tiny town feels like a prison now. My freedom from normal work is taking away my opportunities to see the places I'd like to visit, and has left me without any purpose to my life. I have nothing to aim for unless I make some drastic changes first. Most days I'm just alone, killing time.

I feel guilty for not being happy here. This is what we worked for, but it's no longer enough for me. I want to feel financially secure. I want a job that fulfills me. I want to see my family.

Because of various medical stuff she had going on at the time, we didn’t really speak much. We had been planning to marry and move together. That didn’t happen. I was completely blindsided by all this. Three months later, I left town for medical treatment. Even though she said she wasn’t going to do this, she completely ghosted me when I left.

3141,"Multiple diagnoses, people don’t see PTSD is most important to me I’ve been dealing with PTSD for at least 8 years now, but the things that gave me PTSD started 10 years before that. I’ve also been diagnosed with autism, ADHD, dysthymia and anxiety, and I feel like PTSD is the one diagnosis that is mostly overlooked by the people in my life. Maybe it’s because the events happened so long ago, and the nightmares and flashbacks have been so constant, it’s nothing new anymore, and people have moved on with their lives, while I feel like I’m still stuck.

I have been seeing a trauma therapist and been getting EMDR for the past 1,5 years, although this is intertwined with therapy for my other diagnoses so the trauma isn’t always the most pressing matter. I booked some really progress when I started EMDR and my friends were supportive, but now I’ve been in therapy so long again and told people I had processed a lot of my trauma, it’s not really on the table anymore.

Everyone cares more about my recent autism diagnosis (I self diagnosed myself as an adult and this was finally confirmed after a long process of testing) and my recurring depression. I feel like no one close to me realizes that PTSD is a really serious and “bad” thing, but I also don’t want to keep bringing up what happened all the time and saying it was bad. This is the one diagnosis I feel most alone in. I live alone, and have no partner, and I experience the moments my PTSD is worse alone as well.

The best part of that kind of therapy session is being able to sit down to a good meal at the end of it (or go out to a restaurant if something went horribly wrong). I had to go through multiple therapists until I found the one that could actually help me, but once I had him, it worked -- I still use the techniques he taught me to keep myself on an even keel, and the last time I saw him was almost four years ago.

The hardest part of dealing with PTSD for me was recognizing the new normal that was my life. After my experiences, I wasn't the same person, and I needed to understand and come to terms with that development (and the sense of loss). Creative outlets seem to work for most of my colleagues and I - learning a new skill, or returning to one that you'd put on the shelf. I have found that it certainly helps to be able to build or develop something.

Lastly, being able to talk about it is crucial. I'm not ashamed of having been diagnosed with PTSD. I consider it a normal reaction to abnormal circumstances, and after multiple deployments, I've racked up a lot of abnormal circumstances.

44,"11 dead after suspected ISIS attacks in western Iraq |body| From: CNN

Dozens of militants -- believed to be ISIS members -- attacked several Iraqi security posts and checkpoints in western Iraq's Anbar province Tuesday morning, leaving at least 11 people dead and 18 others wounded, security officials in Iraq said.

The attacks, involving a suicide bomber, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns, happened in the town of Jubbat al Shamiya, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northwest of Baghdad, security officials in the Anbar capital of Ramadi said.

Anbar is a western province largely controlled by ISIS, or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the Sunni Muslim extremist group that has used brutal tactics such as mass kidnappings, beheadings and other abuses against civilians and armed foes to capture vast swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria in the past few years.

Most of those killed and wounded in Tuesday's attacks were Iraqi security force and local Awakening Council members, the security officials said.

Awakening Councils, also known as the Sons of Iraq and Sahawat, are made up of Sunni Muslim fighters who turned against al Qaeda and have been active in Iraq since 2006.

The U.S.-backed councils were credited as being a major factor in a drop in violence across Iraq a few years ago, after the strife that followed the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in 2003.

But council members recently have become targets for ISIS, which has waged war to establish what it says is an Islamic caliphate.

Also Tuesday, ISIS militants attacked the Albu Risha police station in northern Ramadi, killing several police officers and injuring at least two other people, the security officials said.

The battle for the station began early Tuesday, the Ramadi security officials said. After about two hours of clashes between ISIS militants and police officers, ISIS managed to take over the station.

Ramadi is about 70 miles (110 kilometers) west of Baghdad. The Anbar capital has been one of the province's few holdouts against ISIS.

Anbar is home to Al Asad Air Base, where 320 U.S. troops, mostly Marines, are stationed as part of an effort to advise and assist Iraqi forces fighting ISIS.

ISIS' campaign, and the military response to it by Iraqi forces supported by air power from a U.S.-led international coalition, left a bloody toll in Iraq in 2013. At least 17,049 civilians were recorded killed in Iraq last year, roughly double the number recorded in 2013, according to the Iraq Body Count monitoring project.

4659," |body| How to Live to be 400 Years Old

I just finished reading an article in the AARP Bulletin, titled “50 Great Ways to Live Longer.” Right away I knew I had to change my unhealthy ways and calculate my new longevity. My father lived to be 80 years old, so I always figured I’d live that long at least. I did the math below:

If I cut back on my pain pills, I would decrease my chances of heart attack or stroke by 10%. That adds 8 years (don’t get caught up in the details) to my life. That brings my life expectancy to 88 years.

If I get less than six hours of sleep, my chances of dying increases by 12%. Therefore, if I can get in six hours of sleep, my life expectancy increase to 98.5 years. Looking good so far.

If I can stay married, I have a 46% lower risk of death compared to never married men. My life expectancy increases to 143+ years (1.46* 98.5). This might be a tough one.

By drinking coffee, I add another 15% to my life, bring my life expectancy to 165 years (143*1.15). I already drink coffee, so no biggy.

Eating three or more servings of whole grains per day, reduces my death by 20%. Now my life expectancy is up to 198 (165*1.20). I may start to moo.

Eating hot peppers reduces the death rate by 13%, bringing my expectancy to 223+ years. I’m on a roll here.

Drinking whole milk can add eight to ten years to my life. My life expectancy now increases to 233 years (223 + 10).

Switching to a vegetarian diet can deduce my death rate by 12%. As much as I love meat, this switch would add 28 years to my life. Life expectancy is now 261 years (233 + 28).

Stopping smoking reduces mortality by 15% or more. Now I expect to live to 300 (261*1.15%).

Loneliness increases the risk of early death by 45%. Therefore, if I stay social, I can add 135 years (300*.45%) to my life. I may live for 435 years.

My new plan to live to be over 400 is simple -- cut back on pain pills, sleep six hours, stay married, drink coffee, eat three servings of whole grains per day, eat hot peppers, drink whole milk, switch to a vegetarian diet, stop smoking, stay social. You can’t argue with math. See you in 400 years.

So, let's begin! I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 18 and failing at school. That was also the year I switched studies. I always feared people would think I was stupid or dumb, because I wasn't a very good student in high school. This year, I'm in my last year of Social Work. I got into a minor at a University, what means I have to take tests en visit lectures that are more difficult then what I normally do at school now.

At monday, I had to take my first ever test at the Uni. I really prepared myself for that exam en was so nervous I slept really bad the night before. I decided that I could take the car and drive, so I wasn't depending on the trains and bus. It took me one hour and a half (normally a 36 min drive) to get there, so my stress level was already through the roof. I ran into the building, only to see I mixed up the dates and had studied for the exam that was taking place this Thursday 😭. I really had to hold back some tears because I had made myself so nervous and couldn't believe my mistake... it sucks.

I’ve never had a job before (besides babysitting here and there since I was 12) and I’m very nervous. I thought I’d come here for some support and just to get my anxieties out. Here are some things I’m nervous about regarding the job:
•	What if they expect too much of me and I can’t live up to their expectations?
•	I don’t really catch onto things easily. I’m a visual learner so I might need to see a task be done a few times to understand it
•	What if I’m not fast enough at the tasks they give me?
•	What if they yell at me? I’m 19 but it’s hard for me not to cry if someone yells at me

I just feel that I have so much to learn. Even though I completed a 1 year paralegal certificate program, I don’t know nearly enough. I haven’t met the lawyer yet because she is at a trial all this week. The paralegal said that they don’t expect me to know how to do everything in a day or a week and that there is a learning curve but I’m still nervous that they’ll berate me or think I’m stupid if I make some mistakes. Im sure there isnt a lot of room for error in this field. I asked how long they would let me stick around to shadow and he said that it’s up to me and that if I stay for more than 2 months and they think I’d be a good employee then they’ll offer me a paid position. He also said that if I don't think the job is for me then to just let them know and I can go. The paralegal seemed pretty understanding and said I could ask him to slow down if I was getting overwhelmed.

I’m okay with not being paid for now because I still live at home so I have no bills to pay, which I’m extremely grateful for. Interning for 2 months for free may seem long to some people but I’m jst happy to have the opportunity. The paralegal also just took a job as a bailiff so he won’t be there every day, which made me nervous because in my mind I was thinking “what if he throws everything at me and just leaves and expects me to do it all.”
Im wondering if I should let them know 5hat I have an anxiety disorder or just wait a while. Tomorrow is only my second day so I’m still extremely uncomfortable at the office. I suppose the worst thing that could happen is that I can’t do the job and they tell me to leave, but I’m worried that I’ll be yelled at if I do something wrong.

Thanks to whoever reads this. I could use some support and maybe some advice. I need rational people to bring me back to reality! Thank you:)",1.0,reddit anxiety

3731,"(Long?)I really don't know what to make of my life. (Trigger warning: child/domestic abuse, gun violence) Please let me preface that this is going to be disjointed and sloppy as fuck. I apologize in advance.
I was abused by my father from the ages of approx. 8 to 18. My childhood previously was pretty normal.
I think it's pertinent to note that he's an alcoholic combat veteran.

     The first time he threatened to kill me, I was around eight or nine years old. I talked back to him, so he pinned me to a couch by my throat. He said he would snap my neck like a toothpick. I think I may have dissociated, because when I was let go, I felt a mental fog/confusion I'd never felt previously.
     I went to the other side of the house with the full intention of telling my mother who was out of earshot. I couldn't articulate what had just happened, so I made some sort of inane small talk and left.

     Like a lot of kids, I had friends around the neighborhood that I walked around and played with.
     One weekend two of them came to knock on my door to ask to see me. Lucky me, my father was the only other one there to answer.
     ""Come tell your little shithead friends to leave.""
     Naturally, I obliged. As soon as a shut the door, he berated me for what must have been more than an hour about how my shithead friends weren't supposed to come over. The next time I saw one of them they told me they heard it.
     Henceforth, I had to do what I could to shift my social interactions to not interfere with my father noticing. I couldn't maintain this and I grew apart from them.
     I became permanently withdrawn throughout grade school.

     I didn't realize that this was as bad as it actually was. The actual physical abuse I endured was pretty infrequent; however, when it happened it was pretty egregious. He always favored strangling me.

     When I became a teen, the abuse took a strange misogynistic bent.
     ""She'll be pregnant by the time she's fifteen!""
     ""I've seen streetwalkers with more clothes than you!""  (No the fuck he didn't)
      As I was wearing a bulky ass bathrobe to pick up mail on our porch, he saw me and asked, ""Are you really going out in that?"" I decided to not entertain it. ""Yep.""
     ""Well don't come crying to me when you're on the street sucking dick for crack!""

     I can't figure out where tf to put this in my post, but he was obsessed with guns. He had a .44 magnum and AR he constantly fucking cleaned and played with. He had accidentally discharged it once when I was about twelve. My first assumption was that he shot my mom.
     He got hammered once and decided it would be funny to follow me with his new laser scope for his AR at me as I walked past. As most people would, I got irate and told him to stop. This sent him into a rant asking when I would move out. (I had just turned 18)

     I had one fucking friend through high school that I constantly had to debate whether I could leave my mom to hang out with. I spent all night waiting for his fucking chainsaw snoring to start so I knew I could sleep without worried that we were going to be fucking murder suicided.

     It was so fucking frequent that I felt I had to press my ear against my bedroom door to monitor his freak outs at my mom to make sure we weren't in immediate danger.
     He constantly threatened suicide at that point to manipulate her.
     Every fucking time I was paralyzed with '911' inputted on my phone and my thumb against the call button.
     It came when I heard, ""I think you should know what it's like to have bullets flying past your head too."" Fuck that.

     A police officer pulled me out of my bedroom window and walked me to his car to have me write a statement. They took him away and and placed a no contact court order and I haven't seen him physically since.

     The fucked up thing is I was euphoric. I naively thought that my life would all be better with him gone. I hadn't the slightest clue the long term repercussions this would have psychologically.

     It's been a few years and I still live with my mom. I don't have anyone else to talk to but her, and I'm pretty sure there's nothing to say between us.
     I'm so deeply dysfunctional on such a fundamental level.

Luckily for us, there are tools out there for us to block out the crying baby with things like headphones or ear plugs (medication). These headphones can give you a much needed break from all that noise but just because you’re blocking the crying out doesn’t mean the baby has stopped crying. The only way to stop it from crying is to change that shitty diaper.

4581,"First few days on Vyvanse Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a first year medical student. I have been seen by the school psychiatrist 4-5 times now since the beginning of the school year. I knew that I had been depressed for years and that medical school would likely make that worse, so I told my doctor that and she started me on Lexapro. It's worked well.

&amp;#x200B;

For as long as I can remember, I have been very easily distracted and unable to do one thing for very long, but until this year it never caused me any problems. I hardly studied in college at all and still made almost straight A's. Obviously this is not possible in medical school, and it became very apparent while studying for hours every day that I simply cannot focus well enough. I made pretty good grades last semester, but I told my doc that I was worried about the increased course load this semester since I could barely keep up last semester (we went from 23 credit hours in our first semester to 29 this semester).

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I was right to be worried. Right out of the gate this semester, I crashed and burned. I failed my first test of the semester and got the minimum passing score on my second exam. I called to make an appointment with my doctor ASAP. She ended up prescribing me 30 mg Vyvanse, which my younger sister also takes. So far it seems to be extremely subtle. It comes on and wears off so gradually that I'm not even sure how long it lasts for me. I still feel pretty easily distracted while I'm studying. Is it normal for it to be this subtle? I know I shouldn't feel any euphoria or anything, but I wonder if I'm on too low a dose or if maybe I just don't respond well to it.

It’s either depression with psychosis or lingering effects of a UTI ( which I know sounds weird, but apparently it can legit mess with mental health). Ever since my mom went through menopause around age 50 I noticed that she was is more isolated and cries/sobs every single day which she never did before and up until age 50 I had only seen her cry twice in my life! Not only had she started to cry everyday, but she started to say that things in the house had started to go missing- little things such as clocks, cooking utensils, books, toys, little Knicknacks from the thrift store etc. At first she accused another family member of taking the things , but after awhile I would find the missing items around the house.

After a few years, it then progressed to her “sorting” all of her items around the house which resulted in many mixed match items just being thrown around the house in boxes or just scattered around the house. She did this for some time while I was still living with her. Then she changed and out of nowhere she started to accuse me of taking her things and selling  them for drugs. Let me note that I have never taken drugs or took any of her items. When I would find the items that she accuses me of taking she simply stated that she had caught me just in time before i sold them to a drug dealer for drugs. She accused me of taking her baking pans, her pens, her travel bags to a drug dealer! It got so bad that she continued to pack all of her things and then when she couldn’t find it, she would automatically assume I sold them and would barge into my room in the middle of the night threatening to harm me. It got so bad that I had to move out even though at the time she wasn’t working and I had to support her.

Now it has gotten to the point where I haven’t seen my mom in a year and she won’t even let me in the house!! She constantly leaves me messages asking me to bring back her things ( I don’t have access to the house anymore) and is always crying and stated she’s even afraid to leave the house because she still believes I’m taking all of her items! I constantly tell her I haven’t taken anything, but she absolutely refuses to believe me and will go back to accusing me. When I try to prevent her with logic or facts she completely disregards it and goes back to yelling and crying.

I've been reading up on ADHD and I cannot believe now much this relates to me! I am actually stunned. I immediately called my psychiatrist and booked an appointment to see him, but what's next. How do I recover from this? Is there a cure? is making active life changes going to help with ADHD as well? Do I take medication just before studying or do you take it in the morning and then focus on all your tasks in the day? I have had trouble sleeping when I have taken medicine in the past, do ADHD medications cause insomnia???

5563,"Interesting. Well one thing that I have learned is that sometimes when we ask somebody for advice it needs to be from somebody kind of like ourselves. For example, is it best for a married man to ask a single man for advice? Well sometimes yes and sometimes no. It just really depends on the person and the things they have been through. Ten years ago, I was wild, had nonsense of direction quit college at Norfolk State University after doing pretty well academically. Well that didn't matter to me because I was young and I wanted to run the street life. Well I soon found myself in some very bad situations and came to the realization that this life I am living leads to a dead end or will get me nowhere but in jail. I got to that point by running with the wrong crowd and listening to bad advice but GOD blessed me to break the cycle before it broke me.",0.0,rallypoint Set 3
4754," |body| Those whom God effectually calleth, he also freely justifieth, not by infusing righteousness into them, but by pardoning their sins, and by accounting and accepting their persons as righteous; not for anything wrought in them, or done by them, but for Christ's sake alone; not by imputing faith itself, the act of believing, or any other evangelical obedience to them, as their righteousness; but by imputing Christ's active obedience unto the whole law, and passive obedience in his death for their whole and sole righteousness by faith, which faith they have not of themselves; it is the gift of God.

Faith thus receiving and resting on Christ and his (Imputed) righteousness, is the alone instrument of justification; yet it is not alone in the person justified, but is ever accompanied with all other saving graces, and is no dead faith, but worketh by love...

God did from all eternity decree to justify all the elect, and Christ did in the fullness of time die for their sins, and rise again for their justification; nevertheless, they are not justified personally, until the Holy Spirit doth in time due actually apply Christ unto them.

6164,"Anxiety while waiting for text messages! Advice needed! So last night my bf who lives an hour and a half away told me he wasn't feeling well and then the last text I received was around 7:30pm. We see each other on the weekends and once or twice during the week. When we're apart it is extremely rare for me to go more than an hour or two without hearing from him. After 2 to 3 hrs I start panicking. My brain goes to all the what ifs in the book! In this scenario I knew he was sick and probably just went to sleep, I kept telling myself this but when 10pm came around and I still hadn't heard from him I laid awake worrying. Finally fell asleep around 1:30am with the help of my dogs reassuring snuggles. At 5:30 I woke to no messages sigh. 7am I go to work...Still no messages. After my 8am meeting I anxiously checked my phone still no messages. So I called him...nothing. Called on fb messenger...nothing! Finally, around 8:30 he texted me that he was still sick and had been sleeping with his phones ringer off. I about cried with relief. My body was a wreck by this time. Heart beating fast, stomach flip flopping! Mind racing! Can anyone relate?! I always think, back in the days before texting this scenario wouldn't even have been a thing but now with instant expectations it's hard not to fret when a loved one ""disappears"" on us.

""That through death he might destroy him that had the power of death.""
Hebrews 2:14

O child of God, death hath lost its sting, because the devil's power over it is destroyed. Then cease to fear dying. Ask grace from God the Holy Ghost, that by an intimate knowledge and a firm belief of thy Redeemer's death, thou mayst be strengthened for that dread hour. Living near the cross of Calvary thou mayst think of death with pleasure, and welcome it when it comes with intense delight. It is sweet to die in the Lord: it is a covenant-blessing to sleep in Jesus. Death is no longer banishment, it is a return from exile, a going home to the many mansions where the loved ones already dwell. The distance between glorified spirits in heaven and militant saints on earth seems great; but it is not so. We are not far from home--a moment will bring us there. The sail is spread; the soul is launched upon the deep. How long will be its voyage? How many wearying winds must beat upon the sail ere it shall be reefed in the port of peace? How long shall that soul be tossed upon the waves before it comes to that sea which knows no storm? Listen to the answer, ""Absent from the body, present with the Lord."" Yon ship has just departed, but it is already at its haven. It did but spread its sail and it was there. Like that ship of old, upon the Lake of Galilee, a storm had tossed it, but Jesus said, ""Peace, be still,"" and immediately it came to land. Think not that a long period intervenes between the instant of death and the eternity of glory. When the eyes close on earth they open in heaven. The horses of fire are not an instant on the road. Then, O child of God, what is there for thee to fear in death, seeing that through the death of thy Lord its curse and sting are destroyed? and now it is but a Jacob's ladder whose foot is in the dark grave, but its top reaches to glory everlasting.

First kamikaze attack of the war begins


On this day in 1944, during the Battle of the Leyte Gulf, the Japanese deploy kamikaze (“divine wind”) suicide bombers against American warships for the first time. It will prove costly–to both sides.

This decision to employ suicide bombers against the American fleet at Leyte, an island of the Philippines, was based on the failure of conventional naval and aerial engagements to stop the American offensive. Declared Japanese naval Capt. Motoharu Okamura: “I firmly believe that the only way to swing the war in our favor is to resort to crash-dive attacks with our planes…. There will be more than enough volunteers for this chance to save our country.”

The first kamikaze force was in fact composed of 24 volunteer pilots from Japan’s 201st Navy Air Group. The targets were U.S. escort carriers; one, the St. Lo, was struck by a A6M Zero fighter and sunk in less than an hour, killing 100 Americans. More than 5,000 kamikaze pilots died in the gulf battle-taking down 34 ships.

For their kamikaze raids, the Japanese employed both conventional aircraft and specially designed planes, called Ohka (“cherry blossom”) by the Japanese, but Baka (“fool”) by the Americans, who saw them as acts of desperation. The Baka was a rocket-powered plane that was carried toward its target attached to the belly of a bomber.

All told, more than 1,321 Japanese aircraft crash-dived their planes into Allied warships during the war, desperate efforts to reverse the growing Allied advantage in the Pacific. While approximately 3,000 Americans and Brits died because of these attacks, the damage done did not prevent the Allied capture of the Philippines, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.

The worst thing is that I guess they were trying to be supportive but got kind of impatient because I couldn't tell what was going on. One of them also said that every time with me ends up like this, which was harmful and untrue, because really last time this happened was a long time ago.

7113,"Ptsd triggered by guy at work I am a 28 y/o female and I work with kids in an office environment. Most of my coworkers are female, which I like because I feel more comfortable working with women, and I have had traumatic experiences with male coworkers in the past.

One of my coworkers is a male in his mid-50s and ever since I started working there I've gotten a bad vibe from him. About a month ago, I had a dream where he assaulted a kid we work with. Since then, he has cornered me twice and spoken to me in a hostile and confrontational manner.

Today, he motioned me into an empty room, closed the door, and stood about 6 inches from my face. He asked if I had done a particular thing, to which I replied yes. He then told me not to do the thing any more. I honestly can't describe it in more detail because thinking about it is triggering me. But it was hostile and confrontational. My workplace is supposed to be ""magical"" because we work with kids.

The interaction sounds normal, but I experienced it as a verbal assault. To me that's how it felt. This guy and I have the same position, so it's not like he is my superior and has the authority to tell me what to do. I felt all of his hostile energy and I feel bad vibes any time this guy and I are in close proximity to each other.

What should I do to protect myself against this guy's hostile energy that causes my ptsd to be triggered? My gut says quit, die, etc, because people like this have fucked with me in the past. But I like this job and I don't want to quit, and obviously I don't want to die. How can I protect myself? ",1.0,reddit ptsd

First Marine wins Medal of Honor

* Thank you for your Service Marine...S/F

Viet Cong ambush Company A of the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, led by U.S.M.C. Lt. Frank Reasoner of Kellogg, Idaho. The Marines had been on a sweep of a suspected Viet Cong area to deter any enemy activity aimed at the nearby airbase at Da Nang.

Reasoner and the five-man point team he was accompanying were cut off from the main body of the company. He ordered his men to lay down a base of fire and then, repeatedly exposing himself to enemy fire, killed two Viet Cong, single-handedly wiped out an enemy machine gun emplacement, and raced through enemy fire to rescue his injured radio operator. Trying to rally his men, Reasoner was hit by enemy machine gun fire and was killed instantly. For this action, Reasoner was nominated for America’s highest award for valor. When Navy Secretary Paul H. Nitze presented the Medal of Honor to Reasoner’s widow and son in ceremonies at the Pentagon on January 31, 1967, he spoke of Reasoner’s willingness to die for his men: “Lieutenant Reasoner’s complete disregard for his own welfare will long serve as an inspiring example to others.” Lieutenant Reasoner was the first Marine to receive the Medal of Honor for action in Vietnam.",0.0,rallypoint first500

The worst thing is that you hit it on the head, she knew how to hide it.  I won't pretend to know her, but I do know the military system for dealing with those who have had thoughts of suicide.

Good people have taken their lives this year, and every year.  They also didn't show the signs and not all seeked help, and to some of them; it's because they're afraid of the consequences their request for help would have brought.

So a friend just asked an innocent enough question - when I swing depressive, do I need to adjust meds again? I mean maybe, yeah. At the very least my psychiatrist needs to know.

She asked because she thinks I’m swinging depressive. That question made me sob unconstitutionally - not a typo, just a dumb thing I say - for a minute or several or like 30.

I’m not ready. We finally medicated the hypomania out of me and I had like four really good days in a row.

The “I bought new underwear to feel sexy for literally no one because I’d rather self immolate than let someone touch me” feeling. I mean, it’s some shit. This sub understands.

I just hope this shit is medically induced and I’m not going depressive. Hell I’d take “depressive symptoms during a mixed episode.”

I’m seeing a psychiatrist, a practitioner who works with pDoc, my primary care, an individual therapist, plus two groups per week. Like I am working on this. Hard.

(J. R. Miller, ""Devotional Hours with the Bible"" 1909)

""Let him who does wrong--continue to do wrong; let him who is vile--continue to be vile"" Revelation 22:11



The character with which men reach the final judgment--will be their permanent character forever. The man who lives in sin unto the end--is making his own destiny. Habits of sin--make the whole life sinful. It is this that gives such solemnity to life. The seeds of our future eternity--lie in our present.

   sow a thought--& you will reap an act;
   sow an act--& you will reap a habit;
   sow a habit--& you will reap a character;
   sow character--& you will reap a destiny!

Everyone goes to his own place--that is, the place for which he is fitted by his life on the earth. He who has always sinned here on earth--will continue to sin forever.

Eternal death--is simply eternal sin, along with the punishments and consequences thereof. The punishment of the wicked will not be an arbitrary punishment--but the natural result of their own choices and acts in this life.

   As the tree falls--so must it lie;
   As the man lives--so must he die!
   As a man dies--such must he be;
   All through the ages of eternity!

It makes a great difference, therefore, how we live in this world. There is an false impression in some people's minds, that they can live in sin all their days, and then by a few tears of penitence and a cry for mercy in a dying hour--can change all the course of their life and spend eternity in Heaven. This verse does not favor such a view. The future life--is but the harvest of this present life.

Men will be judged by their deeds. The New Testament everywhere teaches the same solemn truth. This does not mean that salvation is by works. We are saved by grace--but grace changes the life and makes us holy.

""To die is gain""--only to those who can sincerely say, ""To me, to live is Christ!""

Symptoms that resemble ADHD and OCD are particularly troubling.

I have disorganized thoughts that are overwhelming when trying to choose a task. Quite frequently I do nothing because it is so stressful. Even making a list of tasks is overwhelming. I also have a tendency to obsess with either perfectionism or just give up because it's too hard to keep up with it.

Symptoms that resemble OCD get overwhelming too. Part of it is about microscopic pathogens. I can't see bacteria, viruses, and other invasive particles, and I obsess about keeping my face, hands, any surface where food is prepared or stored, avoid touching anything the public touches, etc. I have intrusive, obsessive thoughts that plague me.

4718,"Estranged family member I don’t typically use reddit, but I made this account specifically for this because I don’t want it traced back to me.

I’m going to try to make this quick. I am not going to identify how I am related to this family member. We will call him Tim. But nobody in the family has spoken to him in over ten years due to his instability and complete lack of awareness for anybody other than himself. His brother tried for many years to get him help for his mental health, but Tim always refused and lashed out at any family member who suggested he may be mentally ill. Tim was very attached to his mother, living with her for nearly his whole life until she passed, or bouncing around to friends’ couches. Tim was to unstable to be on his own for to long.

Tim was insufferable to be around; always nitpicking everybody, being very sarcastic and rude, a “know it all”. If his absurdly high expectations were not met, the whole family would have to deal with the extreme verbal abuse. Tim’s brother got a divorce, and yet Tim continued to seek a familial relationship with Tim’s brothers ex wife. She entertained this so that Tim could see his nephew, however she would constantly be a receiver of the emotional abuse, simple threats (like threatening to tell her mother that she smoked marijuana occasionally), and insane demands which nobody would fulfill, let alone an ex sister-in-law. He is very much one of those who takes a lightyear when you give an inch.

The family put up with Tim at the insistence of his mother, who pleaded for everyone to keep the peace. She was his enabler and he relied on her for everything. Tim was emotionally and financially abusive to his elderly mother. This escalated to physical abuse, which was the final straw for most of the family. Tim nearly killed his mother in an attack against her because she would not give him x amount of money. Many family members (including the parents of Tim’s brothers, *second* ex wife... so ex in-laws) continued to hear from Tim after this attack, where they were told they were pathetic for turning their back on him in what was an “emotional break” and he had finally been diagnosed with anxiety and depression (a diagnosis that came from a mandatory medical consultation after the arrest).

Flash forward two years after this attack, two years of not speaking to Tim, and two years of constant badgering, Tim’s mother died. The family came together for the funeral, where it was found out that Tim had manipulated his mother to leave all assets to him- where major assets were originally to be left to her 4 grandchildren. The family maintained that this death would not change the relationship anybody had with Tim.

This was the last any of the family saw Tim in person. Tim has continued to harass his family members (brother, ex sister in laws and their parents, cousins, nieces and nephew) via phone calls, email, and letters. It is a constant badgering where he puts everyone down, calling them stupid, pathetic, etc., for “abandoning” a family member with mental illness. He begs for family to contact him in the same letters where he calls them stupid.

A cousin caved and had some contact with him, where he once again attempted to take much more from him emotionally, financially, etc., than he ever offered, and the backlash from being turned down was even worse than the initial badgering.

The latest news is that he has now been further diagnosed with BPD. He is still maintaining that we do not speak to him due to the fact that we are all ignorant and afraid of mental illness. That we are all stupid because we won’t educate ourselves about mental illness. What he doesn’t know is that two of his nieces struggle with depression, and one of them attempted to kill herself, twice. His nephew now has a masters degree in psychology. We all know and understand mental illness, but we also all know and understand that it is best for *our* mental health to not engage in a relationship with him as it will just result in us bending over backwards to accommodate him, and receiving intense emotional abuse (and maybe even physical given what he did to his mother) when we are unable to meet even the smallest of requests. He is clearly still unstable given the content of his letters, and we simply do not feel comfortable being in contact.

I’m not sure what I’m looking for from this. A place to vent, an ear to listen.. maybe even someone to help me rationalize with the rest of the family if we are still making the best decision. We wish we could reach out to him and explain, but we know it would not go over well in the slightest..

Synopsis: After 22 years in the Army, Staff Sergeant Tony Adams is retiring to spend more time with his family. His oldest daughter, Amanda, however, secretly enlists in the Army to follow in her father's footsteps.  When Amanda is killed in action by a suicide bomber, Tony decides to stay in the Army and deploy once more. What he doesn't know is that his unit will be tasked with finding those responsible for Amanda's attack. In the end, Tony finds himself in a battle with a senior enemy commander -- a battle that could cost him his life.

4155,"I’ve drank every night for the last three years and have done nothing to fix it, even though I know I have a problem. I’m 20. My family has a history of alcoholism. I’m 20 years old and I’ve drank almost every night since I was 17 years old. It started with a toxic relationship, which obviously lead to a nasty break up, and here I am.

I started drinking when I was 14 and realized that it eased my anxiety (what I called “being nervous” back then) and immediately loved it. I had to drink at any party to feel comfortable.

Down the road, around 16yo, I realized how drinking made me feel like a normal human being (I never binge drank, but I drank until I would feel comfortable talking to strangers) and that evolved to me drinking alone to calm my mind of all the shit that would go on in there. After that I knew I needed to see someone. Got prescribed zoloft, took it for a week and got upset that I didn’t immediately feel normal like I did when I drank (yeah, I’m a fucking idiot). Stopped taking it. I’d been offered xans and whatnot, but I had always vowed to myself to never take a pill or snort anything. Bad break up happened at 17, been drinking almost every night since then.

Got prescribed to lexapro at 18, stopped drinking for a little and felt amazing after I finally took a month for the meds to set in. Then something triggered my anxiety for a day and I thought a drink would cool me down. One thing lead to another. The meds stopped working when I drank every night. It began again.

I just refilled my lexapro after not taking it for a year. I stopped drinking for a week last month and felt great, but had a glass of wine and beer on Thanksgiving and you know how it goes.

I was sexually assaulted about 3 years ago. Since then Ive had really bad control issues. Like if my boyfriend does something to me sexually it freaks me out but I don’t mind doing stuff to him because I’m in control. If I’m in a car and someone else is driving I feel like Im going to have a panic attack. I went on a rollercoaster ride the other day and had a panic attack because in my head I thought they could make the ride go on forever if they wanted to and it was horrible.

I feel like it if I’m in a social setting and it would be awkward to get out like a university lecture or something I feel panicky.

8043,"I feel like I am rationally moving forward but emotionally stuck. I really don't know where to talk about this, but I hope people here might have some insight. I've spent 4-5 years in therapy and been trying to recover from a very chaotic and emotionally abusive childhood. I'm grateful to have met some good people and had a therapist who has been trustworthy and empathetic. I know that there are opportunities that I can seize on, and despite there being no guarantee of anything, there's no reason not to try and everybody is nervous about the future.

So rationally I have made great strides in realizing where my thoughts of hopelessness, mistrust, and self-loathing are distortions. But emotionally I feel like I am spinning my wheels. I know that if I take up any new task I will have to learn as a beginner, I know that there are career options available to me if I work hard for them, but emotionally I still avoid things and obsess over every possible thing that can go wrong. I've changed career tracks twice in the last 6 months, mainly because I am utterly terrified of being in an underemployed job section or of committing to something that doesn't work out because I'm not good enough to make it work. I hesitate to even do hobbies I like because I get too afraid of what might go wrong. It's not that something might not work, it's that it will end in catastrophe. I know other people feel these kind of fears too but for me it feels like I am ruled by the fear. So cognitively I can see how fortunate I am and that I have opportunities I can take, but emotionally I am afraid of life. I have read enough to know that people who are obsessed with attaining their goals usually do just through sheer work effort and will power. But I feel like I would never be good enough for it. Is this common for people who were traumatized earlier in life? To obsess over when the other shoe will drop and where it will drop and how heavy the shoe might be and if the ceiling's going to come down with it?

3151,"Please read this. Hey guys, I've only posted on here once and it was a bit ago. But I wanted to say something that I hope can help in some way and I'm sure there are some of you who may have also realized this as well.

I read a scholarly article about schizophrenics and it turns out that their confidence is somehow directly connected to their symptoms. It was found that those who had a low confidence and low self esteem tend to have generally more intense symptoms and a tougher time maintaining a fairly healthy and normal life. Whereas those with a good confidence and high self esteem tend to have less intense symptoms and have an easier time managing a normal life.

I've had my own personal moments where I was feeling like something wanted to pull the worst out of me. Like a force was there that was taking advantage of my illness to make the worst of my day and life. One day I finally stopped listening and challenged it, and basically told it in my mind ""why should I listen to you?"" and it stopped for a bit. I began taking my mind off of it and finding things that interested me. There have been times when I get this twisted feeling that starts to come out of seemingly nowhere, like this force is going in for another round. And sometimes if I'm away from my guitar I imagine myself doing something that brings me a little confidence and helps me keep my head up; I picture myself up on a stage playing music and it makes me feel good, and then that evil cloud will dissipate away. Its a really good feeling when I get it to go away. And that only helps further.

I am by no means a professional psychiatrist or really have any say on these things, but basically what I'm saying is that if you have a vent or a special talent that keeps you feeling good about yourself, please stick to it. Whether its dancing, drawing, singing, painting, sculpting, creating, perfoming, helping others, casually smiling to strangers in public as you walk past them, asking to pet peoples dogs, anything creative or positive really.

For me personally its all about positivity, self awareness, healthy skepticism, and confidence. Look for happiness in even the tiniest of places and stick to what makes you happy. But please do watch out for drugs.",1.0,reddit schizophrenia

Because someone thought it was a bright idea to make each and every psychiatric visit (even my follow ups for medication refills) require preauthorization with the turn of the new year. And for smaller offices, it’s completely unreasonable to call for preauthorization on every single visit. Just one preauthorization takes about 40 minutes.

Earthquake rocks Los Angeles


On this day in 1994, an earthquake rocks Los Angeles, California, killing 54 people and causing billions of dollars in damages. The Northridge quake (named after the San Fernando Valley community near the epicenter) was one of the most damaging in U.S. history.

It was 4:31 a.m. when the 6.7-magnitude quake struck the San Fernando Valley, a densely populated area of Los Angeles located 20 miles northeast of the city’s downtown. With an epicenter 12 miles beneath the earth’s surface, the earthquake caused the collapse of several apartment buildings. At the Northridge Meadows complex, 16 people died, all of whom lived on the first floor, when the weak stucco structure fell down on them as they slept.

Given the strength and location of the earthquake, it was fortunate that the death toll was not far higher. Two key factors were critical in reducing the casualties. First, the quake struck in the middle of the night while nearly everyone was at home in their beds. A mall parking lot in the Valley collapsed, but no one was killed because it was entirely empty. Several highways also suffered critical failures, but only one police officer died, when his vehicle plunged off an overpass. The other key factor was that the city’s building and safety codes were strengthened following the 1971 Sylmar quake that collapsed the San Fernando Veterans Hospital. Every building constructed after the new regulations were implemented stayed intact.

Still, the quake caused a huge amount of property damage over a wide area, especially in the beach community of Santa Monica, even though it was relatively far from the epicenter. As much of Santa Monica stands on soil that is less solid than bedrock, it suffered severe ground movement during the earthquake. The partial collapse of the Santa Monica freeway snarled traffic in Los Angeles for months. All told, it is estimated that the earthquake was responsible for $20 billion in damages.",0.0,rallypoint first500

Ben Shapiro |Posted: Oct 04, 2017 12:01 AM

This week, an evil human being murdered nearly 60 Americans and wounded more than 500 others in Las Vegas. His attack was well-planned: The shooter had some 23 guns in his hotel room, including a semi-automatic rifle affixed with a ""bump stock"" allowing the shooter to operate the rifle like an automatic weapon; he had another 19 guns in his home. Video of the incident is chilling: the rat-a-tat of the gun raining bullets down on unsuspecting innocents from the hulking profile of the Mandalay Bay on the horizon, the wounded concertgoers screaming in the darkness.

But there was heroism, too.

The stranger who threw his body atop Amy McAslin and Krystal Goddard to shield them from the rifle fire. ""Just truly incredible,"" McAslin later said, ""a stranger, jumping over me to protect me.""

The off-duty nurse from Orange County who told local news that she ran back into the danger to help the wounded: ""I'm a nurse and I just felt that I had to ... There was so many people, just normal citizens, doctors, cops, paramedics, nurses, just off duty. ... It was completely horrible, but it was absolutely amazing to see all those people come together.""

The anonymous man who threw 18-year-old Addison Short over his shoulder and carried her to safety. The couple who pulled their truck over to carry the wounded to the hospital. The off-duty police using their own bodies to cover the vulnerable. The father who protected his children from gunfire, saying, ""They're 20. I'm 53. I lived a good life."" Jonathan Smith, a 30-year-old who reportedly saved up to 30 lives, taking a bullet to the neck in the process.

It took hundreds of heroes to save hundreds of people; it took one evil man to wound and kill that many.

On the one hand, it is impossible not to lament the extent of evil: A man attacking those who harmed him in no way, possibly gleefully murdering people attending a concert, makes us wonder at the rot that can infect the human heart. But on the other hand, in each incident of horror we must remember how much the good outweighed the evil. Were there hundreds of people like Stephen Paddock, thousands would have died; were there only one person attempting to stop the impact of Paddock's evil, thousands would have died.

All of which means that as we mourn the victims in Las Vegas, we must also celebrate the heroes. We should see the incident as proof of just how much light infuses America from its citizens -- how many normal people run to help each other when evil strikes, when darkness threatens to divide us. So long as that light continues to unite us, America will emerge ready, as always, to fight that darkness.

I’ve gained a bit in recent years and need to cut down for my own health but I’m noticing now that I’m in my 30s it’s harder to get rid of even with diet and exercise. I think stress eating got me here, and the cortisol from stress is keeping it on.

As a child, I misbehaved. I would even say I was more on the naughty end of the spectrum and had a temper (a big one). I was never malicious, though, or destructive.

My mother put a paper grocery bag by the front door and said every time I was “bad” she would put a piece of clothing in the bag and when it was full I would be sent to an orphanage. This terrified me, to the point where I genuinely thought some strangers were going to take me away. I don’t think it helped my behavior any, and to this day I remember the sorrow 7-year old me felt that I would be given up so easily.

2846,"- When I was stationed at FT Irwin, when my ex wife left me, I honestly feel that I personally kept Budweiser in business.  It was horrible.  For a year, when we got released, I would head to the Class 6 and pick up a case of beer.  It would be gone by about 2245.  Pass out.  Wake up for work, rinse and repeat.  Some times I would have dinner chow first.....some times I wouldn't.  I was very self destructive in that passive aggressive manner.  Then, one day, I woke up and realized what I was doing and stopped stone cold for 6 months.  Then, sadly, I got back to drinking beer, and it wasn't as destructive as it was, but it was still not good.  Then I got to Germany.  After three years there, it would be easier to count how often I was sober.  My train wreck of a liver with beer was steady on the tracks until I got back into the Army in '08 and then got together with my wife in '09.  After that, steady as a rock with rarely a beer.

Our policies state that only adults over the age of 18 listed by the parents can pick up from program. Students 4th grade and up can walk home. We cannot release any student to Uber Driver’s. Yesterday evening, a student was not picked up from program. I informed the parent who then told me that all she could do was send an Uber Driver to get her. I told her this was fine, but she also much be present as I cannot release her student alone to the driver. Mom flipped her lid and started verbally attacking me. I told her that if she did not get her daughter that my only other option was to call the local authorities, which only made her attitude worse stating that I am prejudice and that how dare I treat her like a criminal. She finally hung up after threatening to fight me my stating “Get my hair down” to someone else she was with. My supervisor was well aware of this whole situation. After being threatened I did call the police who then tried to mediate the situation, which of course, failed. My supervisor then called the mother where she continued her threats and stated she was coming to her her daughter. I then had to call the police again and was on the phone with dispatch when she arrived. I stayed on the line in case things escalated and you can’t never predict anyone’s behavior. The mom came in, said nothing and left. I’m lucky because nothing escalated yesterday but now I’m having bad anxiety and other PTSD symptoms.

Renounce, denounce, deny self--not good enough, no part in our salvation. Humble ourselves--kill ourselves not self mutilate or suicide physically.

16:18. What does the Christ look like? He must die, suffer, be despised. Jesus Christ is the Rock upon which the church is built. Peter affirms this in 1 Peter 2:5-8

""I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone""
""Whoever believes in Him""
""The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone""

Reality of judgment must be preached

Prospect of losing his life: give life; you get life

Hard preaching in necessary; jokes  aren't good because heaven and he'll are real.

No u-haul behind the hearse can't take anything with you when you die.

Coming with His angels (Christ) only God had angels.

Most of the time i take the easier way and just skip the entire day.

I always come up with excuses like ""just stay in bed other people skip classes a lot too and you will feel like shit anyway.

I could tell there was smth wrong with him, an intellectual disability, or autism, Idk,but he had something. He has no life, stays home all day, 31 yrs old, in college, parents and sister control him a lot. He tells me he wants to be in a relationship with me,I decide to set up a day to meet with him since we live in neighboring states. His family doesn't know he is gay, and he would tell them he met me at his college. He even wanted to hang out while his sister was at work so she wouldn't ask him who he was with. I have no intention of having a relationship with him, but I get close to him anyway. Made him crazy for me. He sent me his nude pics,his address,full name, and #. We started talking about what we would do when we meet. He is a complete virgin. We planned on going to a hotel. He would tell his sister he would be out with me at a cafe, and that he met me in class. So, Friday comes by, and his sister is being noisy, asking questions, and he's asking me how to respond. She wants to know more about me, what I do, etc. I try to get all the info on his sister, and family. I try to get him to give me his sister's #, just so ""I can have it"". He insisted to know why, I told him I just wanted to have it, he said, will you text her, I tell him no of course not. He said, if u delete my nude pictures I will give u her number. So, I told him I deleted them (I really didn't) So the idiot gives me his sister's number, thinking I'm an honest guy. I prepare a text to send to his sister, basically explaining that i'm him boyfriend, we met on a gay dating app, and we plan on going to a hotel together. (i lied about the first two to stir it up). I also included how she needs to stop controlling him and to let him live his life. After that, he starts cursing, sending so many messages, telling me he is straight and not gay, calling me a liar, and a jerk, etc. I tell him you are 100% gay, and don't hate yourself for it, and I was convincing him I did this to help him, trying to fool him. He even threatened to kill me if I texted his sister again. When he did threaten me, I told him, ""dude you just threatened me, I will go to the police now"" So I can scare him even more, he stops messaging me after that. This whole time I had his real number, but from the beginning I had given him a fake number from a free sms app that I use, so he can't trace me ( he is too dumb to do that anyway ) I tried messaging him after that from multiple numbers, and no answers, even tried calling him, and it says his phone is disconnected. I think his family might of cancelled his phone for this, (they are a Muslim family) , and they are punishing him for what he planned with me.

I feel bad that i did this now, but at the time i enjoyed the thrill of it all.

3054,"27 JAN--This Day in US Military History |body| 1967 – A launch pad fire during Apollo program tests at Cape Canaveral, Florida, kills astronauts Virgil “Gus” Grissom, Edward H. White II, and Roger B. Chafee.

An investigation indicated that a faulty electrical wire inside the Apollo 1 command module was the probable cause of the fire. The astronauts, the first Americans to die in a spacecraft, had been participating in a simulation of the Apollo 1 launch scheduled for the next month. The Apollo program was initiated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) following President John F. Kennedy’s 1961 declaration of the goal of landing men on the moon and bringing them safely back to Earth by the end of the decade.
The so-called “moon shot” was the largest scientific and technological undertaking in history. In December 1968, Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to travel to the moon, and on July 20, 1969, astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin Jr. walked on the lunar surface. In all, there were 17 Apollo missions and six lunar landings.

The top American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John Nicholson, heads to Capitol Hill on Thursday where he is likely to endure intense questioning from Senate lawmakers eager for his assessment of the challenges complicating the military’s ability to withdraw from the United States’ longest war. High on that list is the competency of Afghanistan's air force, which according to the United Nations’ latest report is largely responsible for a stunning rise in civilian casualties resulting from airstrikes.

Compared to 2015, the number of civilian casualties caused by Afghan airstrikes doubled last year to 252, according to the U.N. That figure includes civilians killed and wounded. And while American military officials say those numbers are grossly inflated, they have nevertheless begun to fast-track training for a new cadre of Afghan tactical air controllers who can, from the ground, warn pilots when they are at risk of killing innocent people.

What remains an issue of debate is whether this increase in civilian casualties is to blame on the Afghans being overly aggressive or undisciplined, whether it's the result of rushed training, or whether it is the inevitable result of assuming greater responsibility for their country’s security. U.S. and Afghan officials insist these pilots demonstrate restraint while in the cockpit, saying 66 percent of their requests to attack specific targets are rejected over concerns they could result in unintentional deaths.

However, the Afghans’ primary attack pilots are firing their weapons during four of every 10 combat missions, a rate three times greater than that of their U.S. Air Force counterparts, a Military Times analysis shows. And herein lies an enormous predicament, not only for Nicholson, but for President Donald Trump and his administration. The U.S. military's ability to extract from Afghanistan is inextricably linked to the success of Afghanistan's security forces — and most especially its air force, which is seen as a vital link to protecting Afghan ground forces from the pressure they face not only from relentless Taliban militants but from the host of al-Qaida affiliates that operate throughout the country, as well.

“Whenever U.S. officials talk about the various incapacities of the Afghan military, air cover is always at the top of the list,” said Michael Kugelman, an Afghanistan expert at the Woodrow Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. “... The Taliban's growing momentum on the battlefield and its increasingly deadly impact on civilians can no longer simply be shrugged off. Afghanistan needs to do things to bring it under control, and scaling up the capacities of a troubled air force is a modest albeit important step forward.”

5930,"Thoughts: Is Vyvanse not right for me, or is it a dosage problem? Help appreciated FYI: Long, really sorry!!

First, yes, I am doing to talk to my doctor but it would be extremely helpful to hear what other people think about my situation, as compared to their personal experience/things they know.

I’m a 22 y/o woman, diagnosed ADHD-PI about 3.5 years ago. I was put on Adderall briefly but it was a complete no-go.

After that, I was put on Concerta for the better part of two years, all the way until this summer. I’d settled at 54mg. However, side effects began to worsen, I felt it was becoming less effective and more uneven, and it simply wasn’t lasting long enough.

My doctor and I decided to try Vyvanse.

At 20mg I had effects similar to Adderall (essentially sedated). We went to 30mg and it wasn’t nearly as effective as my Concerta had been but my mind felt a bit more streamlined on it than off. It certainly wasn’t doing what I needed or lasting long enough.

40mg was like a slightly stronger experience. Somewhat better than off meds entirely, but it felt like a battle to really work with its benefits. Still, I was hopeful I was on the right trajectory. 50mg felt the same but with more insomnia. We bumped to 60mg, which I’ve now been on for a little over a month.

60mg is where it gets murky and weird. Again, nothing as effective as my Concerta had ever been, but certainly smoother (Concerta was like....boom, your meds have started working, you have 7-10 hours to do your crap, then coach turns into a pumpkin. Toward the end of my time on it was a bad crash).

However 60mg just.....wasn’t working. I realized a week into that I actually wasn’t faring much better than I had been prior to treatment, in terms of functioning.

Vyvanse at this dose feels like that Concerta crash but not sudden/intense—instead it’s this sustained terribleness that lasts all day. I’m very withdrawn, I snap at people, I don’t particularly care about things, and while I don’t feel ADHD-unproductive, I’m just sort of aimlessly reluctant to do anything. I can barely think of what I need to do let alone draw up the momentum to do it. I just sort of lay around.

It’s like anti-ADHD, some sort of monstrous thing that disables me from doing anything or organizing myself at all but in a completely reverse way from my ADHD.

It’s now affecting my personal relationships. Oh, and the insomnia is god awful.

So: Vyvanse hasn’t really seemed to work to any helpful effect, though it’s slightly better than being off medication (60mg is debatable in this respect). I’m almost as unable to do anything as I was without medication, just in a somewhat different sense.

Is the dose simply wrong? I’d assume I’m over-medicated but I feel like I jumped straight from undermedicated to overmedicated. ADHD meds can be different, so perhaps I actually need to up the medication?

Or......is Vyvanse just wrong for me? We don’t all work well with the same meds, is this a miss for me?

While Concerta was giving me some trouble towards the end, its problems were far more manageable and it was actually effective. I’d go back to it if I had to.

From anyone’s personal perspective which might be the best strategy to approach my doc with?

I’d considered lowering Vyvanse dose and perhaps reintroducing something like Wellbutrin (I was on it some time back) to combat the depression-like mood and irritability. I can’t go on SSRIs.

But perhaps an increase should be tried before a decrease?

Or, just end it and ask to go back to Concerta?

This was quite long but as I’m sure you all know, but I need to give this some serious thought and try to deal with it during my winter break.

To anyone who was able to read through this tedious brain-dump, I appreciate it.

Thank you!!!

It started in highschool. My dad died and my mom had a chronic illness. It was such a blur. My grades dropped but it was manageable. I came to a prestigous university, tried to push through and failed out after 2 years.

Now fast forward to another two years later here’s the problem:
I fear writing exams. I fear going to class because I feel everyone is smarter than me. I fear responding to emails because I’ve gotten scary emails in the past (you are required to withdraw, you have been placed on academic probation).
I fear speaking to professors because I feel dumb. I don’t like talking to my friends because they are graduating with jobs or going on to grad school.

I have a couple of exams to write but I have trouble communicating to my professors via email. Its so scary.
I obviously can’t get anywhere until I overocme my fears. I want to do well in life, I want to graduate. But my feelings of hopelessness and feeling worthless always come by when I try to convince myself I am good enough.

5401," |body| Today's Scripture is from Hebrews 9:27




“& as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment""--Hebrews 9:27. As no wisdom, learning, virtue, wealth, or power, can keep us from death, so nothing can deliver a sinner from being condemned at the Day of Judgment, except the atoning sacrifice of Christ. No one will one be saved from eternal punishment that despises or neglects this great salvation. Death is a reality for every member of the human race.

Much too often we fail to realize that death is in the natural sequence of events for man. For the unsaved man, after death there is nothing but judgment. If the death of Christ does not save you, there is nothing ahead of you but judgment. Death is not appointed unto all men—thank God for that. It is appointed to men once to die, but some are not going to die. I hear people talk today about old age and oh, how they want to die and get into the presence of God. I don’t know about you, but I don’t mind waiting. I’m in no hurry to die! I hope I can live until He comes. I don’t know whether I will, but that is the way I would like it.

The people that choose not to follow Jesus are many times those who think that: “I’m a good person.” “I don’t hurt anyone.” “I try to be kind to everyone.” We go from that extreme to: “I don’t believe in nothing that can’t be proven through science” (atheist) and those who are religious but not spiritual. Thus both reincarnation and the belief that physical death is the end of personal existence are excluded. Christ suffered the common human destiny of death and judgment however; for Him the judgment consisted in resurrection and vindication. This vindication will be fully manifested when He comes again.

Today I exhort you to realize that we all are going to die and face judgment. It happens to us daily, in many ways and for many reasons, But whatever the form, we all experience judgment. God is fair and just and He wants everyone to know Him and be forgiven however; not everyone will follow Him. We who trust Christ as Savior don’t need to fear judgment. His death has made forgiveness certain. If you’re not a Christian, trust Jesus as your Savior today and you can have peace in the face of judgment too.


Through the eternal Spirit He offered Himself to God!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I function alright besides the emotional responses to these events, and have varying degrees of experiencing this. Some days I'll ignore it for the most part, and recognize it's crazy, other times I think I've tapped into something many people, with fine mental health experience, but aren't consciously aware of, but subconsciously, and occasionally experience--like a really obscure coincidence. I function mostly by being agnostic to my own beliefs. I acknowledge I have basically textbook symptoms, but there's bits of life that are kinda incommunicable and resonate in ways that can't be quantified or analyzed.

3454,"I need a hug after this weekend. (triggers) (Sorry if formatting is off, im on my phone)

My PTSD comes from some major traumas that happened this year and i can tell it as just emotionless events as though they never really happened to me.
Almost a year coming up to the first major assault that started this whole down spiral.
I used to love drugs and being fucked up and i went to a party with friends as such. My ""best friend"" at the time decided to drive one of my friends home but promised to be right back to get me (she wanted to stay at the party but was DD and decided to drive our friend home and come bacm.) She never got me.
I was assaulted that night and when i told her about it, her response was that i shouldnt have waited for her and that i should have taken an Uber home.
During the summer, I saw the fucker and it sent me into a deeper whole of depression and non stop flash backs. I decided to spend the night at my guy friends house because i felt safe around him.
Until he did the very exact thing to me.
Now it gets TMI but i need to get this off my chest.
This weekend, my girlfriend and i were messing around and i wasnt really into it (i disassociate like nobodys business-also how do you guys stop disassocaiting?) And when i got up to shower and get on with my day she asked if i came. I told her no and that it was ok and she got off the bed and said ""were not done until you cum"" and pushed my head into the couch to take me from behind.
I couldnt stopa screaming no even after she stopped and locked myself in the bathroom for an hour.
When I got out, somehow i ended up COMFORTING HER ON ALL THIS SHIT BECAUSE SHE DIDNT MEAN TO FUCKONG HURT ME.
I can no longer make eye contact with her and have been on fight or flight ever sense.
I guess i just need to vent ans a hug

4043,"Where do you meet quality people? Feeling hopeless. Hey all, how’s everyone doing? A little backstory about me: I’m a 24 year old man, 6’1”, 230 pounds and muscular, an introverted/weirdo artist, an avid reader, explorer, and adventurer. Guitar and lifting weights are my primary hobbies. I’m an electrician involved in a union apprenticeship, so I make great money and have been self-sufficient/on my own for over 2 years now. I have suffered from crippling loneliness and chronic suicidal depression since I was 11. I was extremely scrawny when I was younger (130 pounds in high school) and over the last several years have made strong, active efforts to improve my life, get bigger, and become more confident. I’ve only ever had one real girlfriend who was much older than me (31) and she ended up gaslighting me for 2 years and presumingly cheating on me. Horrible waste of time, money, effort, and devastating to my mental health.
My problem is this. I seem to be doing all the right things for years...lifting, have a solid career, independent, talented, creative, nuanced...but I still struggle big time with loneliness. I have a hard time meet quality women and friends because most people my age are so entrapped in the party lifestyle and that’s not something that has ever fulfilled me. I just long for deeper bonds and relationships built on things that aren’t so purely meaningless and superficial.
A few weekends ago I went to 3 public libraries and just started confidently approaching women I thought were attractive and started making conversation and being flirty. Some were reciprocative, some were shy. I’m actively trying to meet worthwhile women but it’s extremely difficult because I’m naturally not a confident person and am chronically depressed. I think about committing suicide literally every single day because I feel that all of my efforts to improve myself are useless if I have nobody to share them with, nobody to invest in, nobody to create a meaningful relationship with. I feel pretty hopeless so any advice would be appreciated. I know many of you feel the same way.",1.0,reddit lonely

1864,"Interesting thought... I wasn’t always so closed off. I wasn’t always “ant-social.” I was the guy the crack a joke (sometimes dark) at any moment. I would talk to people all the time. Now. I’m not saying that I *don’t* still talk to people (and that’s how some have always been surprised to learn that I do, in fact, have PTSD). I’m a very outspoken and talkative guy. I’ll say my peace with no f**cks given. That’s just who I am now (Infantry, what can I say). But, just a few minutes ago I had a moment of clarity. I describe myself as anti-social. I don’t associate with people. I won’t talk to my neighbors, except to say a quick hi, and my name is... blah blah blah. And I quickly forget them. Some people find that upsetting (and believe me, I understand fully). But, during my time in I was told never to get too close to anyone, that in war anyone could die. Obviously (and understandably) I ignored their advise and made friends. Many of them died. So I closed myself off, understanding that they (those that told me no to make too many friends in the beginning) were right. Then I met my wife (future, at the time), and I slowly let my guard down. I was an NCO at the time, so my choice of friends were limited anyway, but I made a good friend. Could draw so much better than me it was silly. He was a mechanic, and I was regular grunt, but we made a connection. We even lived next to each other. Literally the next house over. Well, he got killed in Afghanistan (I wasn’t with him, I was back at the FOB) and that really hurt me. I lost more friends than most people know exist in a short amount of time, but loosing *this* guy hurt me. So I shut up again completely. I made another “for life” friend who was in my old unit when I was there in my last duty station, but that was because of my wife. I swear, I wouldn’t have been friends with myself if I heard what I said. I was like “Who are these people? I don’t know them? Why would I want to talk with them for??” Little did I know that they (the guy that was in the same unit and me and his wife and two kids) would become the longest lasting friendship I have had in a long time? But you want to know the kicker? If it was up to me, I would have never talked to them. At all. Not ever. It was my *wife* demanded that we talk to them. It took me quite awhile to open up, and at least three months before I even found out that he was in the same unit as me at the same time. Well, I guess the moral of this story is to find someone that understands what’s going on with you, that gets you and at the same time helps you. A long lasting friendship could form if you just reach out. By myself I would have never known them. But now, even though we live many States away, we know that either can come to the other (they’ve asked us once, and we said “Of Course” and they lived in our house, no questions asked for about 5 months once) and ask anything and it will be given freely. I swear, if it wasn’t for my wife, I would’ve been dead a long time ago.",1.0,reddit ptsd

441,"I am so stupid. Less than 12 hours after getting off of Soberlink, he is drunk and lying. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

My partner (42M) and I (30F) have been together for four years; we have a cute house, a wonderful dog... the works. Discussions of marriage and children - as recently as yesterday - have been making their rounds with good outlooks.

&amp;#x200B;

But, he is a binge drinker. A lying one.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to his ex-wife wanting to change the custody agreement with their children in her favor, he has been using Soberlink three times a day, every day, for two years. He has never had a positive test. Even more recently, his ex (and the court) have ordered my partner to get hair follicle testing done. He had three (yes, three) tests done in the span of a month. The first and second came back at 16% and 14%, respectively. The results were deemed inadmissible because the first was before the court order was in place, the second collection was done at a clinic his ex didn't approve of.  Between the second and mandated third test, my partner went overseas for a week-long conference. And there - thinking he was in the clear - he drank. He never shared the results of the third test with me; he mumbled something on the phone that I didn't quite catch.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past 5 months, he hasn't had a drop to drink (as far as I know). There was supposed to be a surprise follicle test done to show he wasn't drinking to the degree his ex was accusing him of. This is why he completely stopped. His ex recently dropped the custody modifications with the court; she could no longer afford a lawyer who charges her $4,000 every appearance made in court and managed to convince the kids that they would be better off with her.

&amp;#x200B;

So today, my partner officially stopped Soberlink. He just came home drunk.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't catch it at first but it quickly became evident he was drinking. To be blunt, he is an asshole when he is drunk. He was rough playing with the dog (something he never does), was slow to respond and react, is bracing himself against doorways and on furniture, and in a bad mood that he blamed on me. It wasn't too difficult to tell. So I said, ""Please don't take this the wrong way, but have you been drinking?"". Immediately, he turns it around on me. His mood was my fault because \*I am acting weird\*. No, of course he hasn't had anything to drink. He refuses dinner, takes his backpack (guess what must have been in it?) up to the guest room and shuts the door.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't the first time this has happened. The other time was about a year ago, he was stressed and decided vodka would be a better ear than I could be. Deny, deny, deny. ""No, I haven't had anything to drink"". I was worried he hit his head outside doing yard work and was ready to take him to the ER. I put him to bed with a big glass of water and kept waking up throughout the night to check on him, thinking I would find him dead from head trauma.

&amp;#x200B;

It came out that yes, he had been drinking. His story changed 3 or 4 times.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just... lost. My mother is an abusive alcoholic; a nightly drinker who used liquor as an excuse to scream and beat my brother and I. My partner can handle a beer or two at dinner and leave it at that. He has been to therapy with an addiction counselor his ex chose (another stipulation of their custody agreement).

Boston Strangler strikes again

***   Proud to say I grew up knowing  MSP  Det LT  Andrew J Tuney Jr.   He was appointed to the     team that caught the Boston Strangler.

***   http://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/07/12/daughter-boston-strangler-investigator-says-father-would-have-been-cheered-new-developments/WE2LLJIFH5lX6Uiv5dCM8H/story.html .

Mary Sullivan is raped and strangled to death in her Boston apartment. The killer left a card reading “Happy New Year” leaning against her foot.Sullivan would turn out to be the last woman killed by the notorious Boston Strangler, Albert DeSalvo, who had terrorized the city between 1962 and 1964, raping and killing 13 women.

DeSalvo’s serial-killing career was shaped at an early age. His father would bring home prostitutes and have sex with them in front of the family, before brutally beating his wife and children. On one occasion, DeSalvo’s father knocked out his mother’s teeth and then broke her fingers one by one while she lay unconscious on the floor. DeSalvo himself was sold by his father to work as a farm laborer, along with two of his sisters.

In the late 1950s, as a young man, DeSalvo acquired the first of his criminal nicknames. He knocked on the doors of young women, claiming to represent a modeling agency. He told the women that he needed to take their measurements and proceeded to crudely fondle the women as he used his tape measure. His stint as the “Measuring Man” came to an end with his arrest on March 17, 1960, and he spent nearly a year in prison.

When DeSalvo was released, his next series of crimes were far worse. For nearly two years, he broke into hundreds of apartments in New England, tied up the women and sexually assaulted them. He always wore green handyman clothes during his assaults and became known as the “Green Man.”

In 1962, DeSalvo started killing his victims. He strangled Anna Slesers with her own housecoat and tied the ends in a bow, which would become his trademark. Throughout the summer of 1962, DeSalvo raped and killed elderly women in Boston. However, by winter he began attacking younger women, always leaving the rope or cord used to strangle the victim in a bow.

Police, who were stymied in their attempts to stop the newly dubbed “Boston Strangler,” even brought in a psychic to inspect the clothes of the victims. However, it was DeSalvo himself who enabled the police to close the case. On October 27, 1964, after raping another young woman, he suddenly stopped before killing her. When the victim called police and gave a description of her attacker, police arrested DeSalvo.

DeSalvoconfessed the murders to his cellmate George Nasser. Nasser told his attorney, F. Lee Bailey, aboutDeSalvo, and Bailey took on DeSalvoas a client.Under a deal with prosecutors, DeSalvo never was charged or convicted with the Boston Strangler murders, getting a life sentence instead for the Green Man rapes. Still, DeSalvo’s life term was short. He was stabbed to death by an unidentified fellow inmate at Walpole State Prison on November 26, 1973.",0.0,rallypoint first500

Her voice cracks sometimes and she acts like everything is fine. She even says “I’m just fine, everything is well” that’s the gist of it all. My brother and I had spoken to her about it at the table and she just declines any type of help or denies anything is wrong with her. We initially thought to approach her in a way where we let her express herself because she’s always been a closed person, but it’s like she mentally is incapable of expressing herself atm.  She doesn’t get defensive but she literally just repeats herself by saying she’s fine. Clearly she’s not. This has happened before and comes in phases. And I’m starting to really get concerned at this point. She’s been diagnosed with psychosis’s twice, and that was 2-3 years ago about, my dad at the time would notice the patterns too, but now since he’s working abroad, I don’t want to concern him with this as well.. I’m not so sure as to what to do, and I don’t want this to get worse for her.

I think this is demonstrated best on CNN when Jake Tapper asked Ocasio-Cortez about whether she described these detention facilities as ""concentration camps"" when Obama was President.  Her response?  ""Well, at the time I was working in a restaurant.""  It's very convenient she says she was outspoken about Obama's immigration policies but she didn't say his administration was running concentration camps.

Age 17 was my worst year by far and I was in disbelief for a long time that I am this broken inside. Once I accepted that I have depression, that I am lonely and there is no simple solution, I began to learn who I am.

4064,"Ultra Ultra Rapid Cycling?? (Self-harm and Suicide Trigger Warning) I don't know what's going on. One minute I'm meh, the next I'm SUPER productive, and the next I am attempting to take my life... over and over.

Like for instance, (**trigger warning ahead, suicide and self harm**)

The day before yesterday, I was ok, then later I put a plastic bag over my head(until my reflexes kicked in), then after that I spent 5 hours sorting my Magic the Gathering cards to sell(organizing, writing prices.. more productive than I've been in months) then after that I got super depressed, cried, and made a real attempt to slit my wrists(but the blade was too dull). Oh and twice during the day I took a hammer to my hand.. WTF

And this has been my pattern! Except now my family is freaking out because I can't hide the attempt. There was a huge discussion on hospital or not, taking my rights away or not, long term facility... I feel really bad. We settled on no hospital, and I'd sleep in my moms room, because... I just always end up manipulating them to let me leave inpatient and I've been over 6 times in 6 months.

Last night I was crying hard and wanting to end it, then I started laughing! Like hard and uncontrollably... then I just spent 2 hours listing on eBay... WTF is going on!!! I just started Geodon last week. I've seen my pdoc and therapist within the last week because I've been so messed up... I've never cycled(?) this fast if that is even what is happening.

I looked in the course catalog.  I picked the classes I wanted. I paid my tuition and fees.  I bought my books.  I read the readings, did my homework, and turned in my assignments.

My trepidation about school was a social one.  I know I was a knucklehead when I was twenty.  There were things I gave great importance to that were not important at all.  There were things I didn't think about that I should have invested a lot more time in.  I WOULD NOT have appreciated someone pointing out the difference.  Especially some Jarhead that was 5-10 years older than me who had been in charge of dozens, maybe hundreds of people, and millions of dollars worth of equipment.  What was I going to learn from someone like that?

And when our ducks are not in a row, we're going to get them in a row, right now, whether it is appreciated or not.

The hard part was leaving somebody else's ducks alone.  Everywhere you go on campus there are ducks walking about randomly.

4721,"I don't have schizophrenia, but I'm wondering if you could give some insight to a bipolar guy re: delusions Like the title said, I don't have schizophrenia. However, a friend of mine who does have it said that it's probably okay for me to post here. If I'm overstepping any boundaries, just let me know.

I have bipolar disorder (my psychiatrist doesn't want to tell me what type, but it's not cyclothymia and not type II), and my manic episodes have been getting more and more severe over time. They have also been happening \*much\* less frequently than before, but when they do happen, it's really bad. I haven't been hospitalized yet (I should have been hospitalized the first episode, though) but I am afraid I will eventually end up in a hospital or in jail. (Shoplifting is one of my impulsive behaviors.)

I don't hallucinate any more than normal but I do get delusions often, especially religious delusions, which I won't go into here. That, plus a lot of energy and grandiosity, gets me ""inspired"" to start a bunch of new projects, which I never finish because I just can't think straight.

The problem is, I am \*very\* used to these episodes from past experiences (i.e., college) to the point that I have trouble distinguishing them from normal mood swings.

6569,"Alone and in terror. First of all, I have to say I'm sorry to everyone who might find this kind of post displeasing. It's kinda my first post here and I am only creating it out of an absolute need to get busy with something.

I am generally a very shy and closed off person prone to anxiety. I'm not completely isolated socially, there are a few good friends but even with them I barely ever talk about any hard or stressful things occurring in my life out of fear of being boring and alienating them. I never talk to them about my family, despite it being a constant source of struggle, I never talk to them about the psychological issues that disturb me. The toughest subjects I can allow myself to raise with them are mild annoyances at work. I have also been single for a few years now.

I always thought that I am good at dealing with being alone. I could always distract myself from the lack of closeness and intimacy in my life with work, hobbies or personal projects. What I failed to notice is that suppressing the need for actual human contact made me compensate for the absence of it in unhealthy and self-destructive ways. A few days ago it pushed me to have physical intimacy with a girl, who happens to be a sex worker. And as these things tend to happen in the most ill-timed moments, our protection failed us. A condom broke. And now I am scared.

I'm not scared of unplanned fatherhood. I don't think this girl would like to have children at all and even if she did I would handle that kind of responsibility. But there is another aspect of course. I have always been worried too much about my health. Maybe my imagination is too vivid or maybe my mind is too much into painting the darkest perspectives but medicine and health issues always freak me out. Usually, that staves me well off having sex with strangers, but in that case, my mental state made me forget my cautiousness for a while. Which, of course, doesn't take the responsibility off me, but illustrates just how unprepared I was for such an accident.

So now I am feeling completely overwhelmed with the fear of having contracted the worst STDs I can imagine. I know how stupid and childish that sounds but I just can not stop thinking about having possibly been infected with HIV. I am googling the early symptoms again and again and picturing my life being completely ruined by the diagnosis. It doesn't help of course that in my country the medical help available for people with HIV is generally poor and not always accessible. There is also no way to get any post-contact prevention measures, they just don't exist around there.  By now I have been having trouble sleeping and focusing on work for several days in a row and I feel like I am starting to invent the symptoms that are not even there.

What terrifies me the most is the complete lack of control. If the worst happened then there is no changing it, no getting better. And I won't find out about it for sure for months. And knowing myself, I feel like I will go crazy with terror during those months. I can't talk about it to anyone. Not my family, there will definitely be no support there. Not my friends, cause I'm afraid they will stop being my friends if I tell them what happened and I desperately need at least some friendship right now. Not to a therapist. I feel like if I really got infected I will need the money I'll spend on therapy to get at least some actual medicine. I feel trapped. And I am so scared. So I am writing this here.

I am really sorry for this rant and sorry for my bad English. I would be really grateful for any advice on dealing with this fear that is driving me crazy. I am feeling somewhat better having written this all, but I know that the fear will be back. I also wish all the best to you, people.

Obviously you can't change your skin colour, but you can do something for the weight. I used to have trouble making friends and talking to people. Guess what, turns out there's loads of people in this world who have anxiety. Most of my friends have anxiety, they're the only ones that understand and are relatable. We stick together  and help eachother fight this stupid mental illness. At one point I realised how this parasite inside of me is killing me, slowly. So I gave it the middle finger, fuck anxiety.

2)	Do not name a section of road, bridge, or other utilitarian inanimate object after me or in my honor. If I was important enough to remember, put it on a sign in an appropriate location - like a DO NOT LITTER sign in a cemetery.
3)	Do not use my SGLI or insurance money to buy a new car and then put a little vinyl decal in the back window that says 'In Memory of.' Just be happy with your new ride - no guilt sticker required.
4)	Do not get a tattoo with a portrait of me in my memory. If you want to ink your body that is your business, but I don't want my portrait in the shower with you. We weren't that close.
5)	Do not get upset if protesters show up at my funeral. Bring them a plate of sandwiches. Once you have gained their trust and distracted them, grab their stupid signs and beat them silly with them.

I made a post not long ago about a severe cell phone addiction of mine, which has been slowly draining my life of meaning.

I haven't used it for a couple hours and will try to get to bed shortly after posting this. Believe it or not, it's already extremely tough. I can't describe how strong the constant urge is to just pick it up and file through every one of my hundreds of notifications.

I'm making a blog documenting this. My experiences, thoughts, and pain. It sounds silly to be suffering from phone usage, but I've lost so much from it, I have a hard time not taking it seriously. A blog is probably far better than spamming this page with content people might not care too much about.

It is not as bad as it used to be, but this particular anxiousness has reared it's ugly head again. So being in a dark, quiet room with no access to the outside terrifies me.
I want to try and do this floating thing because I am under a lot of stress and could use some relaxation (in my last semester of college). At the same time, I don't want to force myself to do it just because it was a gift. I know that I can't let this defeat me every time, but it is so hard to face it.
I don't know what to do. I have CBD oil I could take beforehand, or I could take half of my sedative (that way I'm still functional).
I booked my appointment for 3 hours from now, but I feel like I'm being eaten alive by anxiousness. I don't want to cancel, but I don't want to have a bad experience.
Sorry for the long post. I just don't know what to do.

854,"I have been attending VA counseling for the past two years for both PTSD and couples counseling so my wife could reflect to an independent person how I am reacting at home and around our four kids.
It took me about a 18 months after returning from Kandahar to admit I should be in counseling and be open to use of medication that would stop my anger and since of worthlessness.  I had never experienced anything like this before...

No civilian job can be as important as my military job was to me, but I had to release on the feeling that I was letting people down by not being deployed or in a unit ready to deploy.

I can still yell at the top of my lungs at the drop of a hat and tick off everyone in my family by pointing out every last detail of what they did not do or how they did not meet a standard of perfection.

I still have insomnia, wake up in a panic attack, migraine headaches, night grinding, you get the picture, but all symptoms are better than they were when I started the process.

I took it one step at a time and asked for VA counseling for couples first, then medications, then PTSD counsel, then sleep study, then neurology, etc. just listening to the VA Primary Care doc, counselors, my wife, and some peers I trust who have similar issues.

Invest yourself in your work, family and hobby that you relax doing and can share with others.
When you are work only focus on the work issues.
At home, only on relationships, not the 'work' that is required to run the home.
Find something that allows you to relax, (I still suck at this part...)

VIETNAM WAR VETERAN  BILL ROACH SAYS:

This colorful design, from Rich Boon Preston, with the accents of ""orange"", is a reminder that ""the war is not over yet"" for all of the brave warriors who are still suffering from the affects of this deadly dioxin that was used as a defoliant in the jungles of Vietnam. The quote across the bottom...,""Yea We Have Walked Through The Valley Of Death"", brings memories of how safe I felt once I returned home from the war. BUT THEN, the words that encircle this patch...,""WE CAME HOME, AND DEATH CAME WITH US"", have a rude way of returning me to the stark reality that ""it ain't over 'til it's OVER"", because the ""body count"" for AGENT ORANGE is still being tallied every day. Eventually, this chemical, that was ""unwisely"" used, could end up killing more Veterans than the number of GI's who actually died in Vietnam, while engaged in combat. (Bill Roach).

No More Tears

“And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.” (Revelation 21:4)

Surely this is one of the most glorious promises in the Bible! No more suffering, no more sorrow, no more death! In this present life, in this present world, every one of us must endure suffering and sorrow in various degrees, and eventually death. But our gracious Savior “hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows,” and because “the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. . . . he was cut off out of the land of the living” (Isaiah 53:4, 6, 8), and He endured for us the awful suffering of death on the cross.

In dying, however, He defeated death, rose from the grave, and is now alive “for evermore” (Revelation 1:18). Thus, He can promise immortal physical bodies that will never die again to all who trust Him.

How can He do this? He “shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself” (Philippians 3:21). “The dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed” (1 Corinthians 15:52).

The believers of pre-Christian days will also share in these blessings. Isaiah recorded a beautiful promise to them, as well as us, hundreds of years before Christ came to make it possible. “He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: . . . And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him . . . we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation” (Isaiah 25:8-9).

In case you missed posts that I have replied to, the tumor was registering me as 18 weeks pregnant, when I just hit the 14 week mark. It took longer to break because of the nature of the miscarriage. Two weeks before the miscarriage, the tumor and my baby were ""fighting"" for survival, meaning the tumor was dying, causing me horrible pain, and I mean HORRIBLE. I felt like a 90 year old lady needing a walker, couldn't stand up straight at all. Excruciating... Wise than a kidney stone. Anyways, the tumor ended up winning, cutting the umbilical cord in half, causing my abrupt miscarriage. The day before the miscarriage I had a Dr's appointment, everything seemed fine, baby's heart rate was good, he even waved to us, seems like. The next morning, we lost him. We know the baby was a boy, because I held him in my hands after I passed him, didn't even fill my hand, and I wear small sized gloves, to give you a measurement.

My doctor didn't want any stress on my body, to let me heal, wrote a recommendation to be excuse from any form of employment until further notice, and that TBA was in April. I went straight to my unit to turn in my release papers, and then the story starts from there.

About the third year, it struck me that I was indeed...""out"".

It took another two years to balance that in my heart and soul; to accept that where one mission ended, another was just beginning. This time, it wasn't about being defined by a larger organization's standards...but my own.

Eventually, that was quite liberating. I realized that in my civilian life, I was becoming more valuable to others than I ever had in uniform. Where I led, it was owing to my skills...not my rank. Where I stood out...it became personal. When I failed...I had every right to get back in the saddle-no NAVPERS permission required.

Then, when I least expected it, a move to build my own ""fortress of solitude"" resulted in gaining a new home town, new friends, and the love of my life. Without even thinking, I ended up becoming involved in this group...heading up this board...acting on behalf of this committee-Sometimes, things are just easiest when we let them happen.

One thing that get's down-played in all our discussions is how much we who served ""stand out"" against our peers. We did a great deal, very early in life. We're attracted to challenges...are capable of immense discipline...these things only magnify in effect ""out here"".

For myself, part of the process of getting to that point was, as you suggest, finding a mental challenge...I started researching one of the biggest historical mysteries of the 20th century, and tried to ""solve"" it. After three years, I did. No, History Channel isn't going to run a special on it...no, I'm probably never going to get the 700 page book I wrote about it completed, let alone published...but it gave me a battlefield to face my demons on.

My girlfriends will tell you, in the morning when I wake up, I know they’ll be coming into my bedroom to give me a bed bath, do my toileting routines, pull up my pants, put me in the wheelchair, feed me breakfast, and push me out the front door. I lie there thinking (gagging noise), “Oh God, I cannot face this. I’m so tired of this routine. My hip is killing me. I’m so weary. I don’t know how I’m going to make it to lunchtime. I have no energy for this day. God, I can’t do quadriplegia. But I can do all things through You as You strengthen me. So God, I have no smile for these girlfriends of mine who are going to come in here with a happy face. Can I please borrow Your smile? I need it, desperately. I need You.”

Our weakness, God’s strength. I hate the prospect of having to face the day with paralysis. I choose the Holy Spirit’s help because I don’t want to go down that grim, dark path to depression any more. That’s the biblical way to wake up in the morning, the only way to wake up in the morning. No wonder the Apostle Paul said, “Boast in your afflictions.” Don’t be ashamed of them. Don’t think you have to hide them and gussy yourself up before God in the morning so that He’ll be happy with you and see that you’re really believing in Him. No, no, no. Admit you can’t do this thing called life. Then cast yourself at the mercy of God and let Him show up through your weakness because that’s what He promises—2 Corinthians 12:9.

5226,"Psychiatric worries [x-post from r/depression]

My physician (not psychiatrist) lately has been urging me to try or consider using antidepressants she would be prescribing. Two facts that might be cause for alarm:

* She is hesitant to schedule me an appointment with an actual psychiatrist, saying the psychiatrist in her department has a very full schedule. She assures me she should be able to competently prescribe and oversee medication use on her own.

* Rather than describing the medication and it’s (side) effects in detail, she just gives me brand and generic names to research on my own at home.

Are these cause for concern? If so, how much?

EDIT: She also told me not to use my sun lamp anymore after she saw I had gotten sunburns, even though I reported access to the sun helping my mood. (I might not, in fairness, have gotten across that those burns were from sunbathing rather than sun lamp use.)",1.0,reddit mentalhealth

5627,"- Have you studied up on PTSD at all before making your comments?  I ask because your comments seem a bit insensitive to those who deal with PTSD, and your advice could actually be harmful to someone who has PTSD and is seeking help.  I was taught to NEVER try to erase the memories.  That would just make the anxiety and the condition so much worse.  Learn to work with the triggers appropriately.  Learn to deal with the memories, to understand them and to make them less traumatizing for me personally.  That is personal specific.  I know that may sound crazy to some, but everyone's situation is different and that definitely would NOT be the plan for some because of each individual's unique traumatizing event.  I worked long-term with some great psychologists to deal with memories and, eventually, was able to get through them.  Rada, memories can't be consciously forgotten, especially when dealing with PTSD.  Psychology teaches us that even subconsciously blocking memories can be very dangerous.  The whole premise of the memory issue in PTSD deals with, ""intrusive,"" memories.  They just jump right out at you, often at the most inopportune times and places.  Or, worse yet (for me anyway), in your dreams.  They are worse than the reality of the experience.  They can jar you awake with their horror.  I dream in full color, smell, and sound.  I relive the day, but amplified in my dreams.  Just forgetting isn't a valid answer.  I remember, and I WANT to remember.  I use the memories to honor those who died on that day instead of using the memories to hide behind.  It took me a lot of years to take some good out of the bad, to realize that there were some positives in the memories I have.  I needed the memories to be able to work through the root of the problem.  I enjoy my life.  I've learned to work through my PTSD and survivor's guilt.  I no longer even suffer from depression, though my current attempt to quit smoking is causing some anxiety.  :-)",0.0,rallypoint nock2000

2374,"It Gets Better (MENTIONS OF SUICIDAL THOUGHTS) Hopefully this is the best place to put this. Sorry, I know it's long and rambly.

This time last year, I left what was supposed to be ""the dream job"" in my career field because of a god awful work environment and burnout. It got to the point where all I did was work and then drink when I was off the clock. It was the sort of place that expected people to work overtime for free. I've only been at this job for six month, but it was killing my passion for photography/videography. A part of me wishes I kept a list of all the crap and to show people and other business on how NOT to do video in your newsroom. I didn't enjoy the city I was living in because of work and I didn't get out of the apartment except for work.

I contemplated suicide and I just stopped caring.

My boyfriend (now husband) saw the signs and told me to quit. I was scared at first. Everyone had been so proud of me when I told everyone I got this job. I kept thinking if I just toughened up that it would get better. I never stopped and thought about taking care of my mental health when I really should've.

 I was a mess, honestly.

It was honestly the most terrifying thing I've ever done. I've always done what the ""proper"" thing to do was and leaving a big, snazzy job was not the ""proper"" thing to do. But I did it.

After I left, I got diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety. Apparently the burnout and bad environment irritated some trauma I had from earlier in life and triggered it. That's the short version of what my therapist said when I got diagnosed.

It's not been an easy year. Not drinking was weirdly hard for me and I still crave an drink after a long day. Figuring out how to take care of yourself mentally when you haven't ever done it, is hard. I came from a family that kind of ignores mental health so I was new (I have a little sister who is bipolar and she's been helping me too). I didn't know that I could switch to a different therapist if I wasn't comfortable with them until I got on this sub. I'm going to be starting on medications next month and I'm super nervous about that.

But you know what? I've picked up the camera again. I'm slowly, but surely getting back into it. I'm not sure if I'll ever go back to a newsroom again. I'm weary with the idea of giving a bit corporate  organization my time and energy again, but I'm picking it up.

The good days are starting to outnumber the bad. I'm becoming more confident with the idea of going freelance. I'm even slowly going back to working out.

It takes time, but it gets better. There are days where I still want to just stay in bed and hide from the world. The days where I just cry and I hate myself so much. There are days when I still call my sister because I'm thinking of self harm (not to kill myself, but more like...replacing the mental pain with physical if that makes sense). It's a day to day bases, but I'm so grateful that I finally stopped and took care of myself. I didn't realize how much I was loved until I stopped to take care of myself.

I spiral into this overthinking mode, my heart starts beating super fast and I’m literally imagining that they have somehow died somewhere and I start to cry and hyperventilate and even though my rational self knows there could be a million reasons as to why they haven’t responded, my anxiety tells me “well maybe this one time it’s actually true”.

I have recently graduate from college with a bachelors degree in CS and I have been actively looking for a job, I have applied, been to career fairs, prepared for interviews. But I have also experienced a lot of stress with all the waiting and antecipation, from my support groups I have learned that I shouldn't keep my expectations high because at any moment I can (and I have) crash into a depression, and I can say that although I know this the reality is that it is quite disheartning when I get an e-mail informing me that the company decided to move forward with a more suitable candidate.

Although heartbreaking I push my emotions to the side and remind myself to keep applying because all I need is ONE offer.

In the past I have experienced depression starting with unrealistic expectations and ingratitude. Today after 4 years into treatment and support groups I know I can fight it if I remind myself to put my foot on ground by killing any inkling of expectation and practice gratitude.

In my mid 30s I was on anti depressants after I got sober (been sober off everything for over 13 years) for 9 years and got off them not this August but the one before. My biggest struggle lately is while being on meds in my career I was delusioned into thinking my career was for me. I have been working a job out of town for my 5th year in a row and realize being in my 30s and off meds I do not want to do this anymore and making steps at my age to do it.

I did some EMDR 9 months ago with a horrible therapist who started doing it and asked in one session what my earliest memories of feeling this way were (unbeknownst to me that early childhood experiences may have damaged me) she said these experiences may be the root of some of my troubles. We did one more session and her kid interrupted the session (it was in her home). Anyways, after that I went unhinged and she never warned me of any of this stuff and how becoming unhinged could be related to that so I never went back.

Afterwards, in August I went to work out of town again (which triggers abandonment and causes isolation). I was in some 12 step meeting online and I was talking online about someone elses troubles. Before this happened I was immensely depressed for 5 days and wanted to die at least 4-6 hours a day

In the message i dont remember all that it said but i remembered reading ""When my parents tried to kill me"" then that triggered some sort of flashback to a wave pool where I was 3 or 4 and I remember the depression back then being so angry that I just wanted to die and it felt like my feeling I had at work for 5 days binded to that feeling then and lifted some of it away. The flashback involved immense tears afterwars

This is hard to descibe but I had these flashing anger bands of visualization across my vision or memory similar to when I first did EMDR.

So I dunno what to do. I still struggle with my reality and my situation and when I do even with upgrading trying to go to school for something else. The intense anger of just wanting to die like when I was 4 comes about.

""Peace is that brief glorious moment in history when everybody stands around reloading.""

In a gunfight, the most important rule is ... HAVE A GUN!!!

These are shooting tips from various Concealed Carry Instructors.  If you own a gun, you will appreciate these rules... If not, you should get one, learn how to use it and learn the rules.

RULES

A  Guns have only two enemies:  Rust and Politicians. Rust can be prevented, Politicians cannot.

B  It's always better to be judged by 12 than carried out by 6.

C  Cops carry guns to protect themselves, not you

D  Never let someone or something that threatens you get inside arm's length.

E  Never say ""I've got a gun""  If you need to use deadly force, the first sound they should hear is the safety clicking off, or the hammer cocking.

F  The average response time of a 911 call is 23 minutes; the response time of a .357 is 1,400 feet per second.

G  The most important rule in a gunfight is:  Always Win - there is no such thing as a fair fight.  Always Win - cheat if necessary.  Always Win - 2nd place doesn't count.

H  Make your attacker advance through a wall of bullets ... you may get killed with your own gun, but they'll have to beat you to death with it because it will be empty.

I  If you're in a gun fight:
    (a)  If you're not shooting, you should be loading.
    (b)  If you're not loading, you should be moving.
    (c)  If you're not moving, you're dead.

J  In a life and death situation, do something ... it may be wrong, but do something!

K  If you carry a gun, people will call you paranoid.  Nonsense!  If you have a gun, what do you have to be paranoid about?

L    Never fire a ""warning shot"", that is just one wasted bullet, which could be needed within moments.

M  You can say ""stop"" or any other word, but a large bore muzzle pointed at someone's head is pretty much a universal language; and, you won't have to press 1 for Spanish/Mexican, or 2 for Chinese, or 3 for Arabic.

N  Never leave a wounded enemy behind.  If you have to shoot, shoot to kill.  In court, yours will be the only testimony.

O  You cannot save the planet, but you may be able to save yourself and your family.

2066,"How can it be possible that France is better led than the US...? |body| While President Obama responds to the most deadly terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11 by urging Americans to ""reject discrimination"" and embrace gun control, French authorities are actually taking the real and present danger of radical Islamic terrorism seriously. Over the last few days, they kicked down doors, closed three mosques (with plans to close potentially more than a hundred), and in the process found an alarming number of weapons, ammo, and terrorist propaganda.
""In 15 days we have seized one-third of the quantity of war-grade weapons that are normally seized in a year.""
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve
In an effort to ""close the net on Islamic extremists,"" French authorities have begun the process of shutting down radicalized mosques and raiding locations suspected of housing Muslim extremists. France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said that the raids in recent weeks have resulted in the seizure of an unprecedented number of ""war-grade weapons.""
""In 15 days we have seized one-third of the quantity of war-grade weapons that are normally seized in a year,"" said Cazeneuve.
Since the devastating Nov 13 Islamic terror attack in Paris, French security officials have searched at least 2,235 homes and buildings, confiscated 334 weapons, and taken 232 people into custody.
In a raid of a suspected radicalized mosque on Wednesday, security officials found jihadist documents. Cazeneuve also noted that they placed nine people under house arrest and banned 22 from leaving the country.
The clamp down on problematic mosques is only just beginning, with reports that French authorities have their eyes on between 100 and 160 more that pose a national security threat.
France is not alone in ramping up its anti-terror campaign; several European countries, including Germany, are beginning to take more aggressive action against potential Muslim extremists. German authorities this week sounded the alarm about extremists' attempts to radicalize Middle Eastern migrants. ""Officials said they have encountered at least 100 cases in which extremists have tried to establish contact with refugees,"" reports Express.",0.0,rallypoint first500

8524,"Should I go back to basic or stay home? I enlisted in the Army as a 19D, and was about halfway through basic training when I started having a problem with my eye. I had developed a lazy eye, I went to MACH at Ft. Benning, and was diagnosed with Glaucoma, which caused me to have bad peripheral vision, accompanied by a temporary lazy eye and double vision. They started my 4707 packet, but my paperwork specialist told me that there was a chance it was going to get denied so I thought, great! So I put a request in to my Troop commander, spoke to him, and he agreed to let me continue training and stay off of non-trainer status so that way, if my 4707 got denied, they would just say fuck it and let me stay in, I would still have the required training and I wouldn't get recycled. Well, 3 weeks later, the very week we were supposed to graduate, I was notified that my 4707 packet was at legal awaiting approval and that they were going to have to take my TA-50 and put me on non-trainer status, then shortly after I was sent to RHU and sent home. Things haven't been the same, I have a hard time at home because I enjoyed the army but if I'm going to be completely honest going back scares the hell out of me, because as much as I enjoyed it, it also tore me apart being away from the people I knew and loved, because I knew that things weren't going to be the same.

I’m always told to avoid overthinking, delete negative thoughts, and use my breathing techniques to avoid panic/anxiety attacks.

However, I wake up most mornings with severe anxiety. Before I even turn off my alarm, or think about what I’m having for breakfast, I have a massive pit in my stomach, butterflies, and a racing mind.

Does anybody else deal with anxiety from the moment they wake up, or have any tips to deal with it?

I have knots in my stomach and i feel like im going to vomit currently.

Long story short: husband works in military. We needed to start looking at houses. They changed the schedule and now our plans have to be mega rushed. Like buying a house in 10 days rush. Now, that’s not the part that scares me (i’ve had some time to crumble apart about it and i’ve been working on that). I have a job i just started working at about a month ago. It’s great and my boss seems understanding. When i started out, my anxiety was at an all time high. Due to making mistakes (even though they are understanding about this) as a newbie and being social and talking to people after being a SAHM and not really talking to many adults.

Husband just sprung it up on me that i have to let my job know i can’t work the next 10 days. I’ve already been scheduled and i go in today. I plan on telling my boss after my shift ends but i have no clue what to say or how to say it. I always come across as over apologetic and a rambling mess when i get anxious and i can already see me stuttering and his confused facial expression.

I don’t ‘need’ this job. It’s nothing fancy and i’m really hard working so it’s not hard to establish myself in a new place work wise. But i don’t want to get fired. I don’t want the confrontation.

How do i let my boss know i can’t work the next 10 days without looking like the worst employee ever?

They love me at this job because i get things done and if they ask me to stay later or close, i never say no (i have issues with not being able to say no and then regretting it later for things like work)  so i try to be flexible with them like they are with me.

It was Christmas, everyone was having a great time and i was suffocated by negative thoughts, depression, anxiety, agony and most of all: guilt. I have always been a sensible person and I remember when i was a kid, i used to tell my mother everything bad that i did, even if it was soemthing stupid like stepping on a bug. I would confess my ""sins"" and then i would feel better, but i hated it. I hated that i was the only one who couldn't keep a secret from his mom because the feelings of guilt were to strong and wouldn't leave me alone. It was horrible. That night, the feelings of guilt and anxiety built up very quickly, i couldn't think straight, i started to hyperventilate and shiver, i started screaming and shouting that i was going to die and i definetly thought i would. I somehow managed to go to sleep and for that night, i was safe. So much of a Christmas...The next week it happened again, but this time, it was even worse. I had no one to talk to apart from my parents, but as i said before, i didn't want to ""confess"", i wanted to find another way to cope with my feelings and learn to live without having the urge to tell my parents everything i did. During the attacks, i also thought about suicide, i saw it as the only way to solve my problems, but a part of me, wanated to keep going. One night i told myself: ""I'm going to kill myself"". and the moment i said it outloud, i knew it was a crazy idea. It couldn't end that way. It didn't have to. and so I MADE A CHOICE. i chose to fight. i chose to fight against myself and now i won. It took me a year, but now i'm living the life that i want. i learned how to cope with negative feelings and depression. I read books, watched videos, meditated, did yoga, started going to the gym and finally, after a year i did it. And do you want to know how i knew that it was over? (apart from my attacs going away...) well, i confessed to my best friend, and the moment i did, i didn't feel free, i didn't feel better in any way, because i had leraned to live with my demons and i was stronger. I HAD WON. I love you all guys and the only thing that i want to do now that i no longer suffer from depression, is to help you. I want to increase happiness and positivity in everyone's life.

For years and years I was treated for BPD. I’ve done two DBT groups and only saw Borderline specialized therapists. I started IFS because I felt I needed to address my underlying trauma as opposed to the daily “dealing with emotions.”

I do feel a bit lost about a new diagnosis. While I identified a lot with others with borderline such as feeling empty or being super emotional, there are some qualities I really don’t have at all - but I know everyone is different.

5300,"No, I did not regret getting out. I regret that the Navy was inflexible and refused to give even an inch to a PO1 with 13 years to keep me in. Did the command I was at suck? Yes. But I was part of the leadership and did my best to keep the command on an even keel. I had more time in the Navy and at sea than all the CPOs and below. Only a SCPO and MCPO had more time. I was qualified as high as I could go and was Leading Petty Officer for my division. BUT I had just done 3 WestPacs in 3 years including back to backs (30 days in between) plus a 4 month special op. When I asked about orders I was told I'd be going to a boat, as LPO, on WestPac. The current LPO had just been relieved for lack of confidence or whatever. He was a 10 year CPO. They wanted me to kick butt and get E-Div on that boat squared away. I asked for a boat in the yards so  I could have a breather (sorta). They said no. They needed me out on WestPac. So I said ""NO"". My family came before the Navy finally. It was sad because I had so much invested but I just couldn't turn around and do a 3rd WestPac in a row.

The point is tho, that you have to stick to your guns and realize that no matter how good or bad a command is, it will change. You can change commands and can get a crap one or a stellar one. The Navy is so fluid that nothing stays the same for long. We used to say ""It won't be like this at the next [fill in the blank]""  And yet is overall, the same.

6338,"Anyone else have suicide ideation when things go wrong? Hello, diagnosed with GAD here. I had a bad end of 2018 and early 2019 due to a medication that sent my anxiety into bad spikes, right now I am doing a lot better but still triggers get me bad. And one of my triggers is work (as many others here). I messed up something (fixable but may end up costing money... trying not to think about it) and now I have to face my boss tomorrow and really not looking forward to it.

This kind of situation gives me suicide ideation, and I know it sounds fucked up, but I feel like I wouldn’t go through with it. I just feel like I could end it and not have to face my boss if I died. I know, its such a lame thought but it keeps popping into my head.

7454,"A few days ago my friend committed suicide Hi everyone,

A few days ago one of my friends committed suicide. I wasn't super close to her or anything, but when I heard, I cried for hours. She was such a wonderful person with a huge heart and tried to make things better all of the time. So when I heard the news I was so shocked that she had taken her own life... She had never shared with me that she was struggling with depression or having suicidal ideation.

I've struggled for years with thoughts of self-harm (relapsing back into it) but have always been able to pull myself away from it due to having people in my life who support me. So when I heard the news of her passing, I was so heartbroken that maybe she didn't feel like she had that. Of course, that's speculation... but to me, it just is so heartbreaking.

My depression has been really strong ever since I heard of this and I haven't been able to shake this weight and lethargy. I'm heartbroken for my friend. Please know that you aren't alone and that you'll be terribly missed...

3337,"I Know that in RVN the nature of attacks on tanks and vehicles in general usually resulted in traumatic amputation or death. As was stated before these recent conflicts was were  much more mobile wars with IEDs and RPGs playing a large part in the types of wounds, and better medical attention for them. PTSD and TBI are also being readily recognized as combat injuries, they were not in the past.

I was the recipient of a large command detonated mine (believed to be a dud 500 lb. bomb). It removed the entire right side of the tank, penetrated the hull below my feet and started a turret fire. Normally mines of this size killed at least half the crew. We were lucky, no one bled a drop. I did a quick check and found all of my precious bodily fluids still contained  and being Young dumb and immortal said ""Next"". I had been launched into the roof of the turret and was hurting, but had seen much, much worse. I didn't check out with the corpsman. I was a Marine right! 30 years later my chiro informed me that way back when, I had injured my spine in about four places and it was deteriorating. I dealt with it on my own and tried everything known to man to stop the increasing pain and disability.

I was run off from the VA back in the early seventies, after I went in for help with what was PTSD (as far as they were concerned then, it did not exist) by their shitty treatment, nasty people and an episode they caused that dam near killed me. It cost me an inch out of my left leg.

Shorter story, about 4 years ago I returned to the VA and filed a claim. I now receive 70% service connected but still do not receive anything for my back injuries. The VA has slowly worked with me on the problem, but every 3 to 6 months I am forced onto a cane or stuck in bed until the next go round. I was denied because there was nothing in my medical record and even though I submitted after action reports detailing the incident and the results of others of that type. My detailed claim was about an inch thick. I cannot find any other crew from that day to corroborate. There were only eight of us. We are all old and starting to die off these days.

If you were injured, file a claim, get statements from those who were with you, while you still can, get the after action reports. Persevere. I still do a lot of crazy shit in between the pain, but I sure wish that I had put the ego aside and visited the corpsman. There are a lot of us old Viet vets just now going to the VA, my old gunner is one of them. Don't be like us, it is much better now.",0.0,rallypoint nock2000

2951,"I couldn't agree more with this  . To add on to that, too many people believe that getting turned down at your local VA means you're out Of options. Quite the contrary.

As you said, the very first step is the National Suicide Prevention Hotline.

There are also other veteran advocacy groups and non-profits. The American Legions and VFW's can often times provide access to some legal assistance.

Many do not know that if your condition is service connected and you do not feel you are getting adequate care from your VA, you can request another hospital and if the doctor at that facility agrees you need more help, then you can start the process of getting the VA to cover that treatment.

These things may not be convenient, but we do have a great many veterans and family that get told ""no"" or ""just wait"" by the VA and then just give up. The VA system is not perfect, but you do have more options. Write a Congressman before it gets critical. Go to your news outlets BEFORE the act happens, not after.

I don't know the particulars of this situation, but suffering PTSD myself; if I thought there was even the slightest chance I would hurt my family, I would be sleeping in the front of the VA and then the State Capital or the US Congress.

I simply would not return to those I loved if I had these ideation of hmicide and suicide. As fellow veterans, I believe we have an obligation to help these brothers and sisters out; but at some point, you are absolutely correct: ""IMHO there is no excuse for murder suicide.""

6455,"Eating anxiety? So, for the past six or seven months at least I’ve been struggling with having a REALLY small appetite and being terrified of throwing up. I feel nauseous a lot when I’m out of the house (and sometimes at home too) and I feel like eating makes it worse, to the point where I will avoid doing it unless I’m super hungry.

Restaurants are really difficult for me because even if I don’t eat much (e.g at Yo Sushi I’ll have maybe one or two small plates) I still feel really nauseous there. I’ve thrown up in restaurants quite a few times since I’ve started feeling this way but recently I’ve just been avoiding them/avoiding eating too much.

It seems like going to the bathroom helps, even if I don’t need to go, and I don’t know why.

Does anyone know what this could be? I’m not asking for a diagnosis because I know I need to see a doctor for that but is there anything that could be causing this? I don’t want to go to the doctor if it’s nothing and I’m just being dumb. But I know I most likely can only get better once I know what’s wrong.

5812,"Voice inside my head Does this happen to anybody else or am I just becoming crazy?

This probably started around the time I became depressed and lonely, but I like to talk to myself a lot in my head. I view the voice in my head like a friend and I converse and tell them secrets. I dont really talk much with the friends I have and I don't really have anyone to talk to about deeper things, so the voice in my head sort of resembles my imaginary best friend.

When I look in the mirror or I'm feeling down, it either tries to cheer me up or make me feel even worse. Sometimes it comforts me when I make mistakes, but a lot of times it helps keep my grounded. When I look in the mirror, it tells me how ugly and fat I am, when I'm alone, it tells me how much better everyone else feels without having me around. It tells me how much of a burden I am and how useless and stupid I am compared to others.

I'm not really too sure how to explain it, but sometimes it just feels like I'm talking to myself and sometimes the voice takes on a different personality or is a different person in my head.",1.0,reddit depression
1634,"Asymptomatic infection, autoimmune disorder, possible lymphoma? Basic information: 23 year old female in California of Asian descent, 5'2"" with no pre-existing conditions. Non-smoker who rarely drinks alcohol. No current medications aside from birth control.

Context: 2 months ago, a masseuse noticed a hard lump on my lower, right neck area. It was painless, and I wouldn't have otherwise noticed it because no other symptoms were present. It may have been there for longer.

My PCP determined it to be a potentially swollen supraclavicular node, perhaps 8mm in diameter so not too concerning. Still, he recommended me for an ultrasound and some blood work. Lately, I've been feeling numb, tingling sensations in my right arm and periodic shoulder pain, so I've been concerned something might be pressing on a nerve. It makes sleeping or moving super uncomfortable.

Lab results:

Ultrasound: three swollen supraclavicular lymph nodes, the largest being 1cm in diameter. Monitor until resolved.

CBC/ESR: mild neutropenia with elevated levels of lymphocytes and monocytes. Eryrhrocyte sedimentation rate above normal, suggesting some inflammation.

Chest x-ray: no signs of infection and no discernible swollen lymph nodes in the region.

I have a follow up ultrasound this week which may warrant a biopsy depending on the radiologist's recommendation. I may also have follow up blood work done in 1-2 weeks.
